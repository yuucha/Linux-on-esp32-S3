# Security

This is a research project: a general-purpose Linux running on a microcontroller
that was never designed to host one. It is meant for a workbench and a trusted
home LAN. **Do not put a board running this image on an untrusted network, or
anywhere the network it joins matters.**

Nothing below is a bug report. These are deliberate trade-offs, listed so the
choice to accept them is yours and not a surprise.

## What the shipped image exposes

The default-credential/network warnings apply to both the older images and
the current branch. The new userspace adds private homes, `su`/`passwd` and
per-user cron. BusyBox is SUID root for the applets that require it; ordinary
applets drop privileges. HTTP runs as `www-data`, and web files are not
world-writable. There is no sudo/doas or automatic wheel-group elevation.

**These are Unix permission checks, not hardware memory isolation.** The
NOMMU fork backend does not make untrusted native code safe. Use only trusted
users/programs; do not expose cron, shells or editable CGI to hostile users.
Raw flash backups can contain passwords, WiFi configuration and user files;
keep them private and separate from distributable build artifacts.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Root password** | `changeme123` on every flashed board, until the first login replaces it |
| **Telnet** | off until the first login picks it, **unencrypted** — password and session in clear text |
| **SSH** | off until the first login picks it (`remote-login ssh` later); port 22, password or key until `remote-login port`/`auth` say otherwise; slow on this hardware |
| **Bluetooth LE** | advertises as `Esp32-Linux`, **no pairing, no PIN** |
| **HTTP status page** | off by default (`web-server on` enables it, and it stays on across reboots); no auth, plain HTTP |
| **Firewall** | none. No firewall package ships in the image |
| **Secure boot / flash encryption** | not used; flash can be read and rewritten over USB |

Nothing filters inbound traffic: a port is closed only because no process is
listening on it. `iptables` used to ship with an empty ruleset that changed
nothing until you wrote rules; 0.8 removed it entirely to reclaim flash (see
the changelog), and there is no other firewall tool on the image.

The password is deliberately an obvious `changeme` rather than a plausible-looking
one, so there is no chance of mistaking it for a real secret. The first login
does not hand out a shell until it is changed, and nothing listens on the
network before that: a board joined to WiFi over Bluetooth is not reachable
with the factory password. The first login then turns on SSH or Telnet, one
of them, or neither; `ssh-server on` can still add SSH next to Telnet by hand.
`remote-login auth key` turns SSH passwords off once a key is in
`/home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, which is the setting to use on any network
you do not fully trust; a different port only keeps the log quieter.

### It asks the internet what time it is

Every time the board joins a network it sends an NTP query to `pool.ntp.org`
and to two IP literals belonging to Cloudflare and Google. That is
unsolicited outbound traffic to third parties, and the answer is
unauthenticated — plain NTP has no signatures, so whoever can intercept it can
set this board's clock to whatever they like, which in turn decides whether an
expired certificate looks valid.

It is the same trade every appliance without a battery makes, and the
alternative is a board that cannot do HTTPS at all until someone types the
date. If you would rather it stayed quiet, delete
`/usr/share/udhcpc/default.script.d/50-set-clock` — but it is on the read-only
cramfs, so in practice that means rebuilding the image.

### The Bluetooth link is unauthenticated

Anyone within BLE range can connect and reach the WiFi provisioning dialog. It
is not a root shell — it only scans and joins networks — but that is enough to
**move your board onto a network of their choosing**, and to list the SSIDs the
board can see.

There is no pairing because the point of the feature is joining a network with
no PC and no cable, and the dialog has to work before any credentials exist. If
that trade is wrong for you, delete `/etc/init.d/S46blewifi` and reboot; the
rest of the system is unaffected.

## Past incidents

**Any open WiFi network, joined automatically.** Buildroot's `wpa_supplicant`
package installs its own `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` containing a network block
with no `ssid` and `key_mgmt=NONE`, which matches *any* unencrypted network. A
board built from this repo joined a carrier hotspot on its own, unprompted.

The released images never carried the file, but only by accident — it had been
deleted by hand from an incremental build tree, and nothing here reproduced
that. Fixed by removing it in a post-build script, plus a check in
`make-images.sh`, whose previous check looked only for a `psk=` line and so
missed it entirely: **an open-network block contains no credentials at all,
which is exactly what makes it dangerous.**

If you built from source before that fix, check the board:

```sh
cat /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf     # a network block with no ssid is the bad one
```

## Reporting something

Open a GitHub issue. There is no private disclosure channel — this is a
single-maintainer hobby project, and pretending otherwise would be worse than
saying so. If a finding genuinely should not be public first, open an issue
asking for a contact and leave the details out of it.

No support commitment, no fix timeline, no backports. The reproducibility
caveats and the list of past build defects are in
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
