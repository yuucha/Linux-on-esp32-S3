# Troubleshooting

Symptoms seen on real hardware, with what actually caused them. Most were found
the slow way, so the diagnostic step is included rather than just the fix.

## Boot

### Writes to `/home` crawl once blocks have to be reclaimed

Known limitation of the platform, not of this branch. Writing into clean jffs2
blocks is normal; once the filesystem has to reclaim and erase used blocks,
throughput collapses and a 2.25 MiB write does not finish in ten minutes. The
published 0.6 kernel behaves the same, so this is not new here. Measurements
are in [the erase report](build/verification/2026-09-06-jffs2-erase.md).

Boot no longer depends on it: `S06home-users` gives `home-init` a bounded 45
seconds and continues either way. Keep `/home` well under its capacity and
treat large rewrites as something to avoid.

Recover by rewriting the factory `/home`:

```sh
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port YOUR_COM_ADAPTER \
    --before default_reset --after no_reset \
    write_flash 0xcc0000 ARTIFACTS/home.jffs2
```

That erases whatever was in `/home`. Treat the partition as scratch space.

### First boot stops after `Running sysctl: OK`, or panics there

On an image before 2026-09-14 this was the flash cache: the firmware never
invalidated it after a write Linux made, so `home-init`'s burst of jffs2
writes in exactly this window left the kernel reading stale pages -- a
`Kernel panic - not syncing: BUG!` with nothing before it, a silent hang, or a
script in `/etc` that suddenly has a syntax error. DEVELOPMENT.md incident 15
has the trail and the fix; reflash the firmware. On a current image, read on.

The next line of a healthy boot is `Starting network (background): OK`. If it
stops at `sysctl`, an init script is blocked writing to `/home`. Add `set -x`
to `/etc/init.d/rcS` and to the script on a test board to find the exact line.
The original failure traced to `mkdir -p /home/root` in `S05home`; that script
no longer writes, `home-init` creates the directory instead and `S06home-users`
bounds it, so init continues even when the write is slow.

A fully erased `home` partition carries no JFFS2 cleanmarkers. In the observed
failure, the first `mkdir` stalled and login was not reached within four
minutes. Repackaging with an empty formatted partition removed that stall;
the subsequent clean build reached login in 19.08 seconds. This isolates the
packaging condition but does not prove that every first allocation must erase
all 52 blocks, or establish the exact interaction with execution from flash.

Check the image rather than the scripts:

```sh
python3 -c "d=open('linux-esp32s3-native-full.bin','rb').read()[0xcc0000:0x1000000]
print(d[:12].hex(), d.count(b'\xff'), len(d))"
```

A factory `/home` starts every 64 KiB block with `851903200c000000`. All `ff`
means the image was packaged without `home.jffs2`; rebuild it with
`make-images.sh`, or write that file at the `home` offset. The command
`flash.sh --parts --erase` needs the separate file as well, because erasing
removes the formatting.
A combined image already includes its own `/home` bytes and overwrites them
even without `--erase`. Earlier
releases packaged the partition erased too; whether they stall for as long
has not been measured here.

### First boot reports `tar: invalid option -- z` and `/home/www` is missing

An early experimental image used `tar -xzf`, but its BusyBox configuration
did not enable gzip handling inside tar. The corrected `home-init` uses
`gzip -dc` followed by plain `tar -xf`, checks decompression failure and
cleans its temporary directory. Existing user-edited web files are preserved.
The clean-image test checks the web seed before running migration helpers,
so an already populated `/home` cannot hide this startup bug.

### Boot stops after `mmc_spi`, no panic, no further output

The next line in a healthy boot is `esp32s3-rsa: selftest 512-bit PASS`. If it
never appears, the kernel is spinning in the RSA driver's opening wait:

```c
while (readl(rsa + RSA_QUERY_CLEAN) != 1)
        cpu_relax();
```

That loop has **no timeout**. It waits for the RSA block to be clocked, and the
driver never clocks it on purpose — the SYSTEM clock registers are shared with
the firmware's AES/SHA, so the firmware hands the block over instead, with
`periph_module_enable(PERIPH_RSA_MODULE)` in `app_main.c`.

So a kernel paired with a firmware that lacks that call hangs here, silently.
Fixed in the firmware patch; if you hit it, your firmware is older than your
kernel. Rebuild both from the same checkout.

### Boot stops right at `Run /sbin/init`, having printed everything else

`CONFIG_VECTORS_ADDR` in the kernel config does not match `space_for_vectors` in
the firmware ELF. Linux writes its exception vectors over firmware memory and
dies the instant it executes userspace.

The address is chosen by the firmware's linker, so it **moves whenever the
firmware's size changes**. `make-images.sh` now detects this, realigns the
kernel config and rebuilds — it should not reach you. If you build by hand,
compare them yourself:

```sh
xtensa-esp32s3-elf-nm network_adapter.elf | grep space_for_vectors
grep CONFIG_VECTORS_ADDR .../devkit_c1_16m_linux.config
```

### Guru Meditation boot loop, before Linux prints anything

`CONFIG_KERNEL_LOAD_ADDRESS` must equal `0x42000000 +` the `linux` partition
offset. Moving a partition without updating it produces exactly this.

### `jffs2: Name CRC failed on node at 0x...`

One line during boot, and then everything works normally. A directory entry on
`/etc` or `/home` was written only half way; jffs2 notices during the scan it
does at mount, discards that entry and carries on. The scan exists for exactly
this — it is the filesystem repairing itself, not reporting a fault.

Which of the two partitions it is: the offset is relative to the start of the
partition, so compare it against `cat /proc/mtd`. Anything past `etc`'s
`0x70000` can only be `home`.

Nothing important can be lost this way. The base system is a read-only cramfs
and cannot be touched; what goes missing is whatever that one entry named,
under `/etc` or `/home`. In the case seen here, an empty directory.

It comes from a write cut short — a flash interrupted part way through, or the
power going while something was being saved. Clear it for good by erasing
first:

```sh
./flash.sh --erase
```

Verified: present after an interrupted flash, gone after a full erase and
rewrite of the same image.

### The boot prints almost nothing

That is `quiet` on the kernel command line, since 2026-09-12: the console
carries KERN_ERR and worse, which saves about 0.7 s of a 13.7 s boot on a
115200 line. Everything is still in the ring buffer -- `dmesg` shows it. To
see it on the console at every boot, `bootlog verbose`; `bootlog quiet` puts
it back. That cannot cover a fault before init runs, about 1.4 s in; for
those, `panic_console_replay` dumps the buffer when the kernel panics, and a
development image can drop `quiet` from
`board/espressif/esp32s3/patches/linux/0049-esp32s3-dts-quiet-bootargs-cramfs-root-panic-10.patch`.

### Opening the serial console resets the board

On the CH34x adapter DTR and RTS are wired to EN and IO0, so most terminal
programs reset the board when they open the port. That is a fresh boot and a
fresh WiFi association: for a few seconds after any console session the
board answers no ping and no telnet. It is not a fault. The project's
`serial-probe.py` lowers both lines before opening to avoid it.

### The USB port shows the boot log, then no login

That is the default. The kernel mirrors its console to the chip's own USB
port, but the getty there is off to save RAM. Run `usb-console on` once
from the UART console; it stays on across reboots.

### `scp: Connection closed` right after connecting

OpenSSH 9 copies over SFTP by default and dropbear ships no `sftp-server`.
`scp -O file root@board:` uses the old protocol and works.

### A name will not resolve but others do

Ask the router directly and read the answer code before blaming the board:
`nslookup name ROUTER`. Some routers and ISP resolvers answer NXDOMAIN for
particular names -- `example.com` is one such on at least one home router --
while resolving everything else. The board, its driver and its libc do what
the reply says.

## After boot

### The prompt is `~` but you are in `/root`, and writes fail

`/root` is on the read-only cramfs. Root's home should be `/home/root`, on the
writable jffs2 partition. If it is not, `setup-home.sh` did not run — check that
it is listed in `BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT` in the defconfig.

```sh
grep ^root: /etc/passwd     # should end in /home/root
```

### The board joined a WiFi network you never configured

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#past-incidents). Check for a network block with no
`ssid` in `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`; that matches any open network. Delete the
file and reboot.

### `Command[4] timed out` / `cmd_scan_request ... ret: -22`

A scan request the firmware did not answer. Occasional ones while the firmware
is busy are survivable — `wpa_supplicant` retries and eventually associates.

Continuous ones that never recover used to mean the SoftAP had been brought up,
which wedged the firmware so the STA could no longer scan. The SoftAP was
disabled in 0.3 and the code removed from both the driver and the firmware
afterwards, so this should not happen; if it does, it is worth an issue.

### `curl: (60) peer certificate could not be verified` on every HTTPS site

The clock, not the CA bundle. **The board has no RTC, so it powers on at 1 Jan
1970, every time.** Every certificate's `notBefore` is decades in the future
from there, so verification fails — for *all* sites, which is what tells this
apart from a root that is genuinely missing from the trimmed bundle.

Check first:

```sh
date                                       # 1970 means NTP has not run
grep clock /var/log/network.log            # what it tried, and when
```

The clock is set over NTP from a udhcpc hook, so it needs a DHCP lease *and*
working internet. If it is still 1970:

- **No internet, only a LAN.** Nothing to ask. Set it by hand.
- **UDP 123 filtered.** Some networks block it. Set it by hand.
- **DNS broken.** Two of the three peers are IP literals precisely so this does
  not matter, but if outbound UDP is blocked too, the same applies.

```sh
date -s "2026-07-31 03:30:00"
curl -sI https://github.com | head -1      # HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

Verified on hardware: with the clock at 1970 github, google and example.com all
fail; with it set, all three succeed.

The board now remembers the time across a reboot: `S01clock` writes it to
`/home/.clock` at shutdown and restores it at boot when it is newer than what
the clock says. That is the time the board was last running, not the real one,
but it is on the right side of every certificate date, so TLS works before NTP
answers. A board that lost power without a clean shutdown, or that has never
had the right time, still starts in 1970.

`CURL_CA_BUNDLE` is not what decides this. The bundle path is compiled into
libcurl with `--with-ca-bundle`, so curl finds it with the variable unset and
in contexts a profile script never reaches — CGI, cron, inetd. If TLS is
failing, the clock is the thing to check.

### The status page does not answer

It is **off by default**, and being off looks exactly like being unreachable.
Check and turn it on:

```sh
web-server status
web-server on
```

That setting lives in `/etc/inetd.conf` on the writable `/etc` partition, so it
survives a reboot — but *not* a reflash, which rewrites that partition.
`web-server status` also says which port it is on: 80 unless
`web-server port` moved it.

If `web-server status` says enabled and the page still does not load, inetd is
the thing to look at (`ps | grep inetd`); `web-server on` restarts it as part of
its job, so running it again is a reasonable first move.

### `sh: bad number` after almost every command

This section records the earlier 0.6 BusyBox-login behavior. The current
branch uses Bash for user logins and fixes hush's recursive profile loading
during NOMMU re-execution. Persistent errors, growing chains of `sh`, or OOM
in a current image are not expected: check the image/kernel version and run
`/usr/bin/dash /usr/share/program-tests/hush-login-test.sh`.

In the older **interactive** shell every command
substitution prints it — one to three times, unpredictably — while producing
the right value:

```sh
A=$(echo hi); echo "A=[$A]"
sh: bad number
sh: bad number
sh: bad number
A=[hi]
```

`$(echo hi)` runs no external program at all, so this is hush itself: on a
older NOMMU image it cannot fork, and re-executes busybox to run a subshell. The
message comes out of that path.

It is confined to shells whose stderr is a terminal. Scripts are unaffected —
the boot log and `/var/log/network.log` are clean, and the substituted values
are always correct. Ignore it. If it bothers you, redirect: `cmd 2>/dev/null`.

## Bluetooth

### The board does not appear in a BLE scan

- **Wait ~30 s after power-on.** The BLE stack advertises long before Linux has
  finished booting, and that window is unreliable — core 0 is busy bringing up
  WiFi. This is a known limitation, not a fault.
- Make sure the app scans in **BLE** mode. The ESP32-S3 has no Bluetooth
  Classic, so a Classic-only scan can never find it.
- A phone that has already bonded may not show it in a fresh scan; look under
  paired devices instead.
- Some BLE terminal apps keep a stale connection after disconnecting. Force-quit
  the app, or toggle Bluetooth, before blaming the board.

### Connected, but nothing happens

The dialog does not greet you on connect. **Send any character** and the menu
appears. If it still does not, check the daemon is alive:

```sh
ls -l /dev/esp-ble          # must exist, or the firmware has no BLE
ps | grep ble-wifi-setup
```

`/dev/esp-ble` allows a single reader; a second one gets `-EBUSY`.

## Native userspace

### The shell switched itself to dash, or a switched board will not log in

With WiFi associated there may not be enough memory left for Bash to fork, and
every external command fails with `fork: Cannot allocate memory`. An
interactive Bash login installs a hook that notices this, switches to dash,
prints why, and retries the command. The choice is remembered in
`~/.shell`, so it survives a reboot.

Go back with `use-shell bash`, then `exec /bin/bash -l`. If the board will not
give you a usable shell at all, rewrite the two writable partitions, which
clears `~/.shell` along with everything else in `/home`:

```sh
./run.sh --recover
```

Verified on the board: a second login shell with WiFi up failed to fork at
772 KiB, the hook switched to dash, printed why, and re-ran the command that
had just failed.

The switch happens below 900 KiB of `MemAvailable`. That number is measured,
not estimated: a second login shell on a board with WiFi up failed to fork at
740 KiB, while the same board forks normally at around 1330 KiB. An earlier
700 KiB threshold sat just under the real failure point and never fired.

`MemAvailable` counts reclaimable cache, but a fork here needs real free pages
for its private bank, so the shell can fail well above what that number
suggests. Adjust `LOWMEM_THRESHOLD` in the same file if your board differs.


### Fork fails or processes are killed with several consoles open

Fork support does not add RAM. In diagnostic tests, two interactive Bash
consoles left too little memory for `id`; a Bash primary console with two
detached Dash sessions could also fail while launching `session list`.
For the tested multi-session setup, temporarily replace the primary console
with `exec /usr/bin/dash -i`, and return with `exec /bin/bash -l` afterwards.
Run additional background jobs separately. `jobq` can limit admission for
its own jobs, but cannot reserve memory against unrelated processes.

The instrumented benchmark suite likewise replaces the primary Bash rather
than keeping another shell alive. Functional program tests still run from
Bash. See [the verification conditions](build/README.md#hardware-tests);
passing these bounded tests does not imply arbitrary concurrency is safe.

## Build

Build failures have their own issue template, which asks for what is actually
needed to diagnose one. See also the incidents list in
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) — every entry there was a build that reported
success and produced something wrong.
