# Complete clean build

Run from a clean, committed checkout as a regular Linux user with Docker access:

```sh
JOBS=8 bash build/reproduce.sh
```

This creates a new `build-output/reproduce.XXXXXX` directory. It snapshots the
committed source without `images/`, builds an isolated Debian 12 container,
and compiles the Linux toolchain, base system, ESP-IDF firmware, fork kernel,
MMU payloads and selected userspace. No existing `refs/`, toolchain, image,
experiment binary or compilation cache is mounted into the container.

The container uses host networking for downloads, but has no serial device
or Docker socket. It cannot flash the board. Source and build outputs remain
in the new directory; it does not overwrite the repository's stable images.
Allow several hours, an internet connection and substantial disk space.

`sources.lock` pins upstream Git revisions. Program archives are checked by
the SHA256 manifests used by their build scripts. ESP-IDF pins its own
submodules. The container base is pinned by digest; Debian package updates
and host tools are not a promise of byte-identical output across future runs.

ESP-IDF downloads its own tools from GitHub releases. That step is retried,
and from the third attempt it goes through Espressif's asset mirror by setting
`IDF_GITHUB_ASSETS`, because GitHub returns `504` on those assets often enough
to stop a build. The mirror changes where the bytes come from, not which ones:
`idf_tools.py` still checks every archive against the SHA-256 in `tools.json`.

Two independent builds of `9226140` have now been compared, with separate
work directories and downloads and the same pinned container image. Five of
the eight artifacts came out byte-identical: bootloader, partition table,
firmware, kernel and the factory `/home`. All five recorded build
configurations matched. Of the 772 rootfs entries exactly one differed,
`/etc/shadow`: Buildroot hashes `BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_ROOT_PASSWD` with a fresh
random salt on each run, so the algorithm and the non-password fields match
while the stored hash does not. That one file changes `rootfs.cramfs`,
`etc.jffs2` and the combined image with them.

The build reproduces its content but not its image hashes. Storing an
already-hashed password in the defconfig would make all eight artifacts
identical, at the cost of a fixed public salt for a password that is already
a published default; that trade has not been made here. Reproduce the check
with `build/compare-builds.py LEFT RIGHT`; the recorded run is in
[the verification directory](verification/2026-09-06-reproducibility.json).

Stages and logs are written to `stages/` and `logs/`. A failed stage stops the
pipeline. Retrying inside that same isolated directory may reuse its own
completed stages; it is not a second clean build.

## Outputs

`artifacts/` contains:

- `linux-esp32s3-native-full.bin`: exactly 16 MiB, intended for offset `0x0`.
- Bootloader, partition table, firmware, kernel, rootfs and fresh `/etc` images.
- `home.jffs2`: an empty but formatted `/home`, avoiding the observed
  first-write stall with the fully erased experimental partition.
- `SHA256SUMS`, `build-manifest.json`, `rootfs.json` and `sources.lock`.
- `configs/`: the actual toolchain, Buildroot, firmware, kernel and BusyBox
  configurations, with their hashes in the build manifest.

The full image contains default settings and a formatted empty `/home`, not a backup
of the developer's board. Flashing it replaces existing configuration and
user files. Back up a used board privately before any full-image test.
Never publish raw board backups: they may contain credentials and user data.

Point `flash.sh` at this directory with `--images`; without it the script
reads `images/`, which holds the 0.9.1 release. Its default combined-image
write replaces `/etc` and `/home` even without `--erase`. `--parts` preserves
`/home` but still replaces `/etc`, including accounts, password hashes and
network configuration. `--parts --erase` resets both, writing `home.jffs2`
when the directory has one. Missing files, invalid sizes or inconsistent
partition layouts stop the script before any esptool invocation.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/image.yml` is manual and runs the whole thing. Start it from
the Actions tab with **Image → Run workflow**, on any branch. It runs the
host-only checks, then two complete builds from pinned sources in parallel, and
then compares every artifact between them and publishes the result in the run
summary. Each build uploads its images, checksums and logs.

Expect a couple of hours; the job limit is six. The runner has no board, so
`board_verification` stays `pending` in the manifest: flashing and the 36 board
tests are still a local step.

The older `build-linux.yml` builds the base system only and is kept for
rebuilding that path; it is not the pipeline that produces the released image.

Run the host-only regression tests with `python3 build/test-*.py` -- flash,
shell fallback, keepconfig, kernel config, bash's vfork patch, `bootlog`, the
`wifi` script, the first login, `remote-login`/`ssh-server`/`web-server`, the
clock, NTP, BLE and USB console services, and the soak runner's classifier.
The board runs its scripts under BusyBox hush, not bash: `build/host-hush.sh`
builds the image's hush for the host, and `BOARD_SH=<that path>` runs the
script tests under it. hush exits a `set -e` script when a `while read` loop
ends, which bash and dash do not. They use temporary images, a
simulated esptool and stub shells, never a serial device. `test-wifi-script.py`
also refuses one shell shape outright: a heredoc inside a `( subshell )`, which
the image's busybox ash cannot finish although every host shell can.

Three tools drive the board itself, all through the serial console:

- `build/test-board.py PORT ARTIFACTS --output DIR` is the suite: 36 checks
  tied to the exact image by reading the kernel and rootfs partitions back
  and hashing them.
- `build/extra-board-tests.py PORT [DIR]` is what a person does with the
  board and the suite does not: a detached session, cron firing, `passwd` and
  a fresh login, a reboot that keeps `/home`, jffs2 written and read back,
  the shell under fork load, a subshell with 30 KiB of arguments (#22),
  `bootlog` across reboots.
- `build/soak-boot.py PORT ARTIFACTS --output DIR --rounds N` measures the
  factory-boot fault rate: each round rewrites `/etc` and `/home`, holds the
  board in reset until the port is listening, watches the boot, then logs in
  and reads `dmesg` and the taint flags back -- a `quiet` console shows
  KERN_ERR and worse only, so the console alone cannot decide. A round is
  PASS only on positive evidence, and the summary carries a one-sided 95%
  bound on the rate; twenty rounds are the least that bound means anything.

A fourth drives the board over the network instead: `build/test-ssh-pty.py
PORT` reads the board's own `wifi status` over the console to find its IP,
skips cleanly if WiFi is not configured, then opens SSH from the host with
`get_pty=True` -- the `ssh -tt` equivalent -- and checks a real `/dev/pts/N`
came back, the regression for issue #9 (dropbear falling back to a `/dev/pty??`
scan this kernel does not build). It turns SSH on with password and key on
whatever port `remote-login` has, and puts the settings back when done. It
needs `paramiko` on the host in addition to `pyserial` and `esptool`.

`build/test-network-services.py PORT` does the same for `remote-login` and
`web-server`: it moves SSH to 2222, tries password-only, key-only and both
with a throwaway key, moves Telnet to 2323 and the web page to 8080, checks
each from the host, and puts the board's settings back. Both log in with the
password the harness set on the first login; on a board with its own, pass it
as `MMU_BOARD_PASSWORD`.

`./run.sh --test`, and so `--all`, runs all of them in that order: the
suite, the extra tests, then the two network ones if `WIFI_SSID` and
`WIFI_PASS` say which network to join (`build/board-wifi.py` joins it over the
console; without them they are reported as skipped, not passed), then the
soak, `SOAK_ROUNDS` rounds, 20 by default. The summary at the end names each
part.

All of them answer the first login themselves, with the password
`esp32s3-board-test` and SSH. `./run.sh` runs `build/factory-login.py PORT`
at the end, which puts back `changeme123` and nothing listening, so the next
console login asks again; after running a script by hand, run it by hand too.

The fork backend is built by `experiments/mmu-poc/fork/build-kernel-reclaim.sh`
with the page-set exchange on; `FORK_SWAP_BANKS=0` builds the copying model.

The packager checks partition limits, the firmware/kernel vector address,
the fork kernel setting, root's shell, BusyBox SUID mode, excluded programs,
and every component's bytes inside the combined image. It leaves hardware
verification explicitly `pending` until the exact image has been flashed
and tested. A successful build alone is not proof that it boots.

## Hardware tests

After backing up the board and explicitly flashing the full BIN at `0x0`,
run with a Python interpreter that has pyserial installed:

```sh
python3 build/test-board.py /dev/serial/by-id/YOUR_COM_ADAPTER \
    build-output/reproduce.XXXXXX/artifacts --output build-output/board-check
```

The output directory must not exist. The runner verifies the local artifact
checksums and reads the installed kernel/rootfs through their MTD devices to
compare their hashes. It then tests remapping, fork, process compatibility,
the selected programs, job admission, benchmarks, users and permissions,
HTTP, cron, detached sessions, COM reconnects and persistence across reboots.

Before anything else the runner quiesces the board: it lowers the console
shell's `oom_score_adj` and stops the DHCP client. On an idle test image that
client has no lease to keep, but it forks its script on every retry, and with
around 1.3 MiB free that fork has killed both a measured program and the
console shell itself. The reboot test brings the network back.

Functional program tests run from the Bash login. For the instrumented
benchmark suite, the runner replaces that login temporarily with Dash,
then logs back into Bash. Keeping an additional interactive Bash alive
while measuring nested Bash pipelines exhausted RAM in the development run;
that combination is not a supported concurrency guarantee. Services remain
enabled during the measurements, which is deliberate but means a background
fork can arrive at the worst moment: measuring Bash drives available memory
down to under 100 KiB, and a DHCP lease event running its script there has
killed the measured program. A run killed that way is retried up to three
times and each retry is printed; only repeated kills fail the step.

Session tests use a Dash primary console, restored to Bash afterwards.
Two detached Dash sessions with a Bash primary console could leave too little
RAM even for `session list`; two interactive Bash consoles could not fork
`id`. The separate `nohup` test runs from the normal Bash login, without the
two sessions. This suite does not claim those combined workloads are safe.

It creates temporary users and jobs and removes them on the normal cleanup
path. It requires root access, the default Bash login policy, cron enabled
and HTTP initially disabled; do not run it against an unrelated production
installation. Cleanup is best effort: when the console itself times out, the
temporary accounts stay on the board and the next run stops on its own
precondition check. Rewrite the two writable partitions to return the board
to the factory state before retrying, which is faster than the full image and
leaves the kernel and rootfs untouched:

```sh
./flash.sh --backup somewhere/private     # first, if the board has data on it
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port YOUR_COM_ADAPTER \
    --before default_reset --after hard_reset \
    write_flash 0xd0000 ARTIFACTS/etc.jffs2 0xcc0000 ARTIFACTS/home.jffs2
```

The underscore spellings are deliberate: `build/Dockerfile` pins esptool
4.8.1, which rejects the hyphenated forms that esptool 5 prefers, while
esptool 5 still accepts these with a deprecation warning. One spelling works
with both.

If esptool left the freshly flashed board in its bootloader with
`--after no-reset`, add `--reset-from-bootloader` to explicitly reset it via
RTS and capture the complete startup log. Do not use that option on a running
filesystem with unsaved changes. The suite also checks both hardware RSA
self-tests and the read-only cramfs mount in the kernel log.

`results.json` records the exact image hash and each test's outcome/time.
Logs and a failed result remain available if any check stops the run. These
results also record the hashes of the runner and its external test scripts.
Only a fully passing run updates `build-manifest.json` with the hardware
verification result and report location; image bytes are not changed.
These tests use the actual board and reboot it; they do not flash it, enable WiFi,
test an external WiFi connection or establish isolation from malicious code.

## Verification status

The clean build of `ee9e06d5a4634325376dc33d3a149d09580cf1fb` passed all 26
hardware checks on 2026-09-06, including a factory first boot in 19.08 seconds.
The exact 16 MiB image SHA256 is
`e0a066fc66eb929b13f36c3a77278aa647361c2073aadcb210df6c30054b55b7`.
See the [verification record](verification/2026-09-06.md) and its archived
machine-readable results for scope and limitations. This result applies to
that artifact, not automatically to future code changes or other profiles.
The committed `images/` are the 0.9.1 release, a clean `./run.sh` build of
`71244b2` on the release branch. The board suite, the extra tests, the soak,
SSH and the network tests under `verification/2026-10-05-clean-*` ran on
those exact bytes ([record](verification/2026-10-05-fix-22.md)); what came
after that commit is tests and docs only.
