# Architecture — how Linux and the WiFi firmware share one ESP32-S3

> The native dual-core layout was verified from a clean build for 0.6.
> The current branch adds a tested experimental fork backend and userspace;
> its new combined-image clean-build verification is tracked in
> [build/README.md](build/README.md). Do not conflate the two sets of evidence.

## The big picture: two cores, two operating systems, one chip

Unlike the emulated (RISC-V/Sv32) edition — where a single Xtensa core runs
an emulator that interprets a foreign RISC-V CPU in software — this edition
runs **real Linux compiled directly for the ESP32-S3's own Xtensa
instruction set**. No emulation, no interpretation. The tradeoff: the
ESP32-S3's WiFi radio is driven by a closed binary blob that only runs
under ESP-IDF/FreeRTOS, so Linux can't own it directly. The solution
(`esp-hosted`, upstream jcmvbkbc project) splits the two cores:

```
ESP32-S3 (single chip, two Xtensa LX7 cores)
│
├── Core 0 — ESP-IDF / FreeRTOS ("network_adapter" app)
│   ├── Owns the WiFi radio (closed blob) directly.
│   │   Talks to Core 1 over shared memory (shmem IPC).
│   └── NimBLE peripheral — advertises as "Esp32-Linux" (Nordic UART
│       Service). A byte pipe only: it never drives the WiFi radio itself.
│
└── Core 1 — Linux 7.2.4 (real, native Xtensa binary)
    ├── esp32-ng driver (drivers/net/wireless/espressif/esp32-ng/)
    │   ├── espsta0 — STA netdev, joins the home WiFi (wpa_supplicant).
    │   │             STA only: the AP side was removed (see below).
    │   └── /dev/esp-ble — the other end of the BLE pipe (single reader)
    ├── BusyBox services + Bash user shell, nano, Dash and GNU Make
    ├── MicroPython, socat/nc, cron, dtach sessions and process tools
    ├── wifi — interactive scan/connect helper for the STA uplink
    ├── ble-wifi-setup — runs the provisioning dialog over /dev/esp-ble,
    │                    through the same `wifi` command (see BLE.md)
    ├── espctl — GPIO/I2C control from userspace
    └── / (cramfs, read-only, XIP) + /etc and /home (jffs2, writable)
```

This is the AMP (asymmetric multiprocessing) architecture the emulated
edition's own planning docs flagged as "high risk, don't start there" —
except `esp-hosted` already built and maintains it upstream, which is why
this edition exists at all.

## Boot flow

1. ROM bootloader → 2nd-stage bootloader → `xipImage` (Linux kernel,
   executes in place from flash, not copied to RAM).
2. Kernel brings up `espsta0` (STA) → fires `CMD_INIT_INTERFACE` to
   Core 0's firmware → `esp_wifi_set_mode(WIFI_MODE_STA)` +
   `esp_wifi_start()`. The driver never creates an AP interface (see below),
   so the firmware stays in plain STA mode.
3. userspace: `S45inetd` (nothing until the first login picks ssh or telnet)
   → `wpa_supplicant` on `espsta0` (via `/etc/network/interfaces`, joining the
   WiFi set with the interactive `wifi` command or `wifi connect "SSID" "PASS"`).
   That step runs in the **background** so it does not hold the login prompt
   (see `S40network`); its output goes to `/var/log/network.log`. With no
   network chosen yet there is no `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`, so
   `wpa_supplicant` exits and that log records the failure — the expected state
   of a freshly flashed board, not a fault.
4. `S46blewifi` starts `ble-wifi-setup` if the firmware exposed `/dev/esp-ble`,
   so the board can be joined to a network from a phone with no PC and no
   cable. Core 0 has been advertising since long before this point, which is
   why connecting in the first ~30 s is unreliable (see BLE.md).

## Why there is no SoftAP (STA only)

Earlier versions created a second netdev (`espap0`) and let Core 0's firmware
run a SoftAP with a fixed SSID/password. It was removed because it never
worked and actively hurt: the closed WiFi blob beacons as **WEP** instead of
WPA2, so clients reject it, and — worse — bringing the AP up wedged the
firmware's wifi task so `CMD_SCAN_REQUEST` never returned, meaning the STA
could no longer scan or associate.

It was first disabled (the driver was hard-forced never to create `espap0`) and
has since been **removed outright**, on both sides. The board is **STA only**:
it joins an existing network, it does not host one.

- Kernel: the esp32-ng driver is back to its pristine upstream form plus the
  BLE pipe. Gone are the `.start_ap`/`.stop_ap` cfg80211 ops, `cmd_ap_start`/
  `cmd_ap_stop`, the `CMD_AP_*` and `EVENT_AP_*` protocol codes, the
  `esp_ap_password` and `ap_iface` module parameters, and `NL80211_IFTYPE_AP`
  in `wiphy->interface_modes`. `ESP_MAX_INTERFACE` is 1 again.
- Firmware: `cmd.c` is byte-identical to upstream again — `process_ap_start`/
  `process_ap_stop`, `configure_softap_fixed`, the AP half of `wpa_funcs`
  (`hostap_init`, `wpa_ap_*`, `hostap_sta_join`) and the `WIFI_EVENT_AP_*`
  handlers are all gone. WiFi start-up went back to upstream's model too: the
  event loop and `esp_wifi_start()` live in `process_init_interface()` behind
  the `!sta_init_flag` guard, rather than running once at boot — that
  restructuring only ever existed so the AP beacon would carry its RSN element.
- The vendored ESP-IDF is untouched again; it used to have `hostap_sta_join`
  un-`static`ed so the AP authenticator could link against it.
- The firmware is built with `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SOFTAP_SUPPORT=n`, so the SDK's
  own AP machinery is not compiled in either. That is a supported ESP-IDF
  configuration, not a hack: with the option off it provides an empty
  `net80211_softap_funcs_init()` that overrides a weak symbol in the closed
  WiFi library, which is built to run STA-only.

Restoring an AP would require both radio-side support and a validated userspace
configuration. The new fork backend removes one earlier userspace obstacle,
but does not restore the removed AP driver/firmware operations or prove that
hostapd fits and works. SoftAP remains unsupported.

## Fork and memory banking

Linux still runs in NOMMU mode. The fork patches keep a private page set per
process and move it on scheduling transitions; `/proc/meminfo` and
`/proc/PID/status` expose the associated accounting.

Since 0.8, `swap-banks.patch` is the default (`FORK_SWAP_BANKS=1`, the build
default): a context switch exchanges the resident contents with the incoming
process's set instead of saving and restoring a separate backup, so the
running process owns no backup of its own and N processes sharing a region
need N-1 page sets instead of N. It was suspected of corrupting memory and
built out for a week; that turned out to be incident 15 (the flash cache, not
this), and with that fixed, twenty factory boots ran clean and it shipped --
see `experiments/mmu-poc/fork/README.md` and incident 16 in DEVELOPMENT.md.
`FORK_SWAP_BANKS=0` builds the older save-and-restore copy model instead. The
backend requires UP Linux, rejects multithreaded fork and limits private
memory per fork to 512 KiB by default (`fork_bank_max_bytes`). `libfork.so.0`
exposes the compatible userspace entry points; it does not replace the whole
C library.

There is no copy-on-write, and there cannot be one on this chip: the TRM
(section 15.6) specifies that an unpermitted write is dropped and raises an
asynchronous interrupt, not a restartable fault. Without a fault to copy the
page and retry the store from, COW has nothing to hang on. There is no
hardware isolation either.

`mmu-run` is separate: it loads constrained freestanding Xtensa payloads and
switches owned remap pages. Ordinary Bash/Make/MicroPython processes use the
Linux FDPIC loader and the fork backend, not `mmu-run`.

## Storage layout (devkit-c1-16m profile, 16MB flash / 8MB PSRAM)

| Partition | Offset | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nvs` | `0xa000` | 20K | ESP-IDF NVS (unused by Linux) |
| `phy_init` | `0xf000` | 4K | WiFi PHY calibration data |
| `factory` | `0x10000` | 768K | `network_adapter.bin` (Core 0 firmware) |
| `etc` | `0xd0000` | 448K | jffs2, writable, wear-leveled — `/etc` |
| `linux` | `0x140000` | 4M | `xipImage`, XIP kernel |
| `rootfs` | `0x540000` | 7.5M | `rootfs.cramfs`, read-only root |
| `home` | `0xcc0000` | 3.25M | jffs2, writable — `/home` |

The authoritative source of this layout is
`new-files/esp-hosted/network_adapter/partition_table.esp32s3.16m8r`, and this
table is a copy of it — if the two disagree, the CSV is right. It matters more
than it looks: the kernel derives the rootfs XIP address from the partition
offset (`0x42000000 + 0x540000`), so flashing `rootfs.cramfs` at the wrong
offset panics the kernel with "Cannot open root device". A booting board prints
both, which is the quickest way to check this table against reality:

```
0x000000540000-0x000000cc0000 : "rootfs"
cramfs: checking physical address 0x42540000 for linear cramfs image
```

The layout has been recut several times — `rootfs` grown for curl and its CA
bundle, then again for nano and ncurses; `factory` grown for the BLE stack;
`linux` and `home` shrunk to pay for it. Moving `rootfs` means the kernel's XIP
address moves with it, and moving `linux` means `CONFIG_KERNEL_LOAD_ADDRESS`
(`0x42000000 +` the `linux` offset) has to move too, or the board boot-loops in
the bootloader before Linux prints anything.

`/` is read-only cramfs by design — no wear on the root filesystem no
matter how the system is used. Anything that needs to persist (WiFi
credentials, init scripts, host keys) lives under `/etc`, and user data under
`/home` — both separate writable jffs2 partitions mounted **over** the cramfs.
Note the consequence: a file baked into the image under `/etc` or `/home` is
shadowed at runtime by the jffs2 mount, so it only shows up on a freshly
flashed board.

## Security model

- SSH (`dropbear`) and Telnet (`telnetd`) both require a real login
  (`/etc/shadow`, SHA-256). Default password `changeme123`, deliberately
  obvious rather than plausible-looking. `first-login` runs from root's login
  shell and does not give a shell until it is changed.
- No session timeout, no brute-force throttling yet.
- Nothing listens on the network until that first login, which then turns on
  SSH or Telnet, one of them, or neither (`remote-login ssh|telnet|off`). Telnet is plaintext
  on the wire; SSH is not. `remote-login port` and `remote-login auth` set the
  ports and whether SSH takes passwords, keys or both; the settings sit in
  `/etc/remote-login.conf` and inetd.conf is written from them.

## Known gaps

Recovery mode and OTA are not implemented. GitHub Actions exists for the
earlier base pipeline; it is not hardware-in-the-loop verification of every
new image. There is no SoftAP — the
board is STA only (see above). curl's HTTPS support works but is experimental.
