# Building from source

See [README.md](README.md) if you only want to flash the prebuilt images —
this file is about rebuilding them.

The project is not a normal source tree: it is a set of **patches and files
applied on top of three upstream trees** (a kernel, buildroot, and the WiFi
firmware), all cloned fresh by the build script. This repository holds the
delta, not complete mirrors of those upstream source trees. That is why the
layout looks the way it does:

- `patches/` — diffs against pristine upstream clones.
- `new-files/` — whole files copied into those trees (board config, defconfig,
  rootfs overlay, firmware profile files).
- `kernel-driver-esp32-ng/` — a readable reference copy of the WiFi driver.

`apply-local-changes.sh` puts all of it in place automatically, and the build
script calls it right after each clone, so a clean build reproduces the shipped
images. The sections below explain how that is wired and how to redo it by hand
if the script is ever lost.

## Complete current-branch build

```sh
JOBS=8 bash build/reproduce.sh
```

Use a clean committed checkout. This pipeline includes the fork kernel and
all selected userspace, not only the base Buildroot image. It snapshots the
source into a new output directory, compiles the Linux toolchain there,
fetches pinned sources and builds a combined image without mounting any old
experiment binaries or build tree. See [inputs, outputs and verification
status](build/README.md).

The final image is for offset 0x0 and replaces the whole flash, including
configuration and user files. Hardware testing must back up a used board
privately, flash the exact checksum-identified artifact, and distinguish a
clean first boot from a later boot with restored user data.

The pipeline does not flash or publish anything. The clean image built from
`ee9e06d` passed 26/26 hardware checks on 2026-09-06; the
[verification record](build/verification/2026-09-06.md) identifies its exact
hash and limits. This is functional clean-build validation, not proof of
bit-identical rebuilds. The remaining sections document the older base
pipeline and historical 0.6 verification, not proof of the new userspace.

## Legacy base-only Docker build

Debian 12 is used deliberately: its GCC and CMake are old enough not to trip
the "host tools too new" failures a rolling-release distro hits. From the root
of this repo:

```bash
docker build -f new-files/toplevel/Dockerfile -t linux-on-esp32s3 .
mkdir -p build-output
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/build-output:/work/esp32-linux-build/build \
    linux-on-esp32s3
```

**Create `build-output` yourself first** — that `mkdir` is not optional. Docker
creates a missing bind-mount directory itself, as **root**, and the container
builds as an unprivileged `builder` user, which then cannot write into it. The
run dies within seconds on the first clone:

```
fatal: could not create work tree dir 'esp32s3': Permission denied
```

It fails loudly rather than producing a half-built image, but the message
points at git rather than at the mount, so it is easy to misread.

The image clones jcmvbkbc's `esp32-linux-build`, patches it with
`patches/00-...`, and drops `apply-local-changes.sh` plus the 16MB board
profile next to it. The run then fetches crosstool-NG, buildroot, esp-hosted
and the kernel, and builds everything into the mounted `build-output/`. It
takes hours; the toolchain alone is most of it.

**Verified**, end to end: a clean clone of this repo, built in this container,
runs to completion, and the images it produces boot on the hardware. That is the
whole path — nothing from a local working tree in the middle of it, which is
exactly what four earlier failures had been hiding in (incidents 4-7 below).

The images shipped with the releases were built natively rather than in Docker,
so they are not bit-identical to a container build; they are the same sources.

## Without Docker

The host needs a working build environment (autoconf, automake, bison, flex,
cmake, rsync, texinfo, ...) and a GCC that is not too new. If the host's GCC
defaults to C23 (15/16.x), GMP's configure breaks; the wrapper works around it
by putting a directory of gcc-14 symlinks first in `PATH` — set `GCC14_SHIM` to
it, or create `~/esp/gcc14shim`. On an older host, skip that.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulneja/Linux-on-esp32-S3
git clone https://github.com/jcmvbkbc/esp32-linux-build
cd esp32-linux-build
patch -p1 < ../Linux-on-esp32-S3/patches/00-esp32-linux-build.patch
cp ../Linux-on-esp32-S3/new-files/toplevel/apply-local-changes.sh \
   ../Linux-on-esp32-S3/new-files/toplevel/devkit-c1-16m.conf .
./rebuild-esp32s3-linux-wifi.sh -c devkit-c1-16m.conf
```

Images land in `build/build-buildroot-esp32s3_devkit_c1_16m/images/` and in the
firmware's build directory. `flash.sh --parts` in this repo documents which
image goes at which offset.

## Packaging the images

There are two build paths, and they are not interchangeable.

`build/reproduce.sh` is the current one: it builds the fork kernel, the MMU
runtime and the expanded userspace, and packages a complete 16 MiB image with
checksums. Use it to produce the system this branch describes.

`make-images.sh` below is the older path. It packages the base system only
and does not include fork, Bash or the added programs.

The base build driver compiles everything but stops there — it does not gather
the results or package them. `make-images.sh` closes that gap:

```bash
./make-images.sh /path/to/esp32-linux-build   # after a native build
./make-images.sh build-output                 # after the Docker build
```

Either shape works. A native build leaves an `esp32-linux-build/` directory
with `build/` inside it; the Docker build mounts a host directory *as* that
`build/`, so afterwards all that exists is `build-output/` — the build
directory itself, with no parent to point at. Run with no argument and it
looks for all three.

It collects the six binaries into `images/`, checks each one fits its
partition, refuses to package an `etc.jffs2` that has a `psk=` line in it, and
merges everything into `images/linux-esp32s3-native-full.bin` for offset `0x0`.

Two things it does deliberately, both learned the hard way:

- **It regenerates `partition-table.bin` from the CSV**, never copying the one
  the firmware build emits — that one comes from an older CSV that puts rootfs
  at the wrong offset, and since the kernel derives the rootfs XIP address from
  the partition table, booting it panics with "Cannot open root device".
- **It refuses images carrying WiFi credentials.** buildroot's `target/` is
  incremental, and a stale `target/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` left over from a
  manual test once got baked into `etc.jffs2` and shipped. WiFi belongs at
  runtime (`wifi connect`), never in the image.

Running it against the tree that produced the published release reproduces
`linux-esp32s3-native-full.bin` byte for byte (same sha256).

## Historical 0.6 reproducibility caveats

The observations below describe the legacy pipeline and its 0.6 builds.
The current integrated pipeline pins upstream revisions in `build/sources.lock`;
its separate verification status is documented in [build/README.md](build/README.md).

- **The upstream trees are tracked by branch, not by pinned commit.** The build
  driver clones `jcmvbkbc/buildroot -b xtensa-2024.08-fdpic`,
  `esp-hosted -b ipc-5.1.1` and the kernel tag the same way. If upstream moves,
  a rebuild can produce different output, or a patch here can stop applying.
  That is upstream's design, not something this repo overrides.
- **Reproduced from a clean clone of this repo, on real hardware, following
  only what is written here.** `git clone`, `docker build`, `mkdir -p
  build-output`, `docker run`, `./make-images.sh build-output`,
  `./flash.sh --erase` — no other step, and nothing taken from a local working
  tree. The build ran 43 minutes; the board then booted in 11 s, passed both
  RSA self-tests, joined WiFi and reached the internet.

  Walking it that way is what found the two defects that made it impossible:
  `build-output/` had to exist before `docker run` or the build died on its
  first clone, and `make-images.sh` could not be pointed at what the Docker
  build leaves behind. Both were invisible from a working tree, because the
  directory always already existed and the images were always packaged from a
  native build. A rebuild of a tree that already works cannot find either.
- **The rebuild matches in size, not bit for bit** -- and the reasons are
  worth knowing, because they say what "reproducible" can mean here. A clean
  clone built in Docker, compared against the images committed here (built
  natively on Arch):

  | | differs by | why |
  |---|---|---|
  | `bootloader.bin` | nothing | byte-identical |
  | `partition-table.bin` | nothing | generated from the CSV in this repo |
  | `network_adapter.bin` | 80 bytes of 687040 | a build stamp ESP-IDF embeds |
  | `xipImage` | 9% | see below |
  | `rootfs.cramfs` | 14.5% | see below |
  | `etc.jffs2` | 4 bytes of ~24000 | jffs2 metadata |

  The kernel's 9% is one string. `Linux version ...` embeds the build
  `user@host`: `paulneja@arch` natively, `builder@<container-id>` in Docker.
  Those are different lengths, so everything after it in `.rodata` shifts and
  every pointer table reaching past it changes with it. The code is the same
  -- 96% of the text strings are identical and neither image embeds a build
  path.

  The rootfs's 14.5% is real: whole 512K regions are byte-identical while
  others differ heavily, and the ones that differ hold the large userspace
  binaries (`nano` and `libcurl` in the worst of them). Arch and Debian build
  those differently. Note cramfs stores no timestamps at all, so that is not
  it.

  So: compare behaviour, not checksums. Only
  `linux-esp32s3-native-full.bin` is worth checksumming, and only against
  images built the same way -- it is a concatenation of the others, so it
  reproduces exactly when they do.
- **It took four fixes to get the first from-scratch build working**
  (incidents 4-7 below): the container was missing `cpio`, one patch was being
  discarded in silence, and both the firmware patch and the defconfig had
  drifted behind the tree the published images were built from. Nothing built
  before those is comparable.
- **GitHub's source ZIP drops the executable bit.** Git stores it correctly
  (`100755`), so a `git clone` is fine; if you downloaded the ZIP, run
  `bash flash.sh` or `chmod +x *.sh` first.

## How the pieces fit

The build driver (`rebuild-esp32s3-linux-wifi.sh`) is **upstream's**, not ours:
it clones crosstool-NG, buildroot, esp-hosted and the kernel, and builds them.
Left alone it would build jcmvbkbc's project, not this one.

`patches/00-esp32-linux-build.patch` is what changes that. Besides the
host-tool workarounds, it adds two lines — one after the buildroot clone, one
after the esp-hosted clone:

```sh
[ -x ../apply-local-changes.sh ] && ../apply-local-changes.sh buildroot
[ -x ../apply-local-changes.sh ] && ../apply-local-changes.sh esp-hosted
```

Those two lines are the hinge of the whole thing. Without them the build
silently produces the upstream project — it does not fail, it just builds
something else. `apply-local-changes.sh` then applies
`patches/03-buildroot-tracked-changes.patch`, copies `new-files/board` and
`new-files/configs` into buildroot, applies the firmware patch and commits it
locally (the firmware's own CMakeLists runs `git reset --hard` on every `cmake`
invocation, so a local commit is the only thing that survives).

It finds this repo's `patches/` and `new-files/` by looking for `$LOCAL_CHANGES`,
then `./local-changes` (what the Dockerfile sets up), then any directory beside
or above it that has both — so the checkout's directory name does not matter.

The kernel patches are **not** applied by that script: they are wired into
buildroot itself via `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH` in
`configs/esp32s3_devkit_c1_16m_defconfig`, pointing at
`board/espressif/esp32s3/patches/linux/`. Buildroot re-applies them after every
kernel extraction, including ones triggered mid-session — see below for why
that matters.

**Verified against fresh independent clones** (not against an already-patched
tree): the buildroot patch applies to a fresh `jcmvbkbc/buildroot
-b xtensa-2024.08-fdpic`, the firmware patch to a fresh `jcmvbkbc/esp-hosted
-b ipc-5.1.1`, and the kernel series to the kernel.org `linux-7.2.4.tar.xz`
(CI checks that one on every push). The series comes from
[linux-esp32s3](https://github.com/paulneja/linux-esp32s3): work on the kernel
there and export it with `git format-patch --zero-commit upstream-v7.2.4..X`,
where X is the last commit before the `nommu`/`nommu-bank` ones. Those fork
commits ship as `experiments/mmu-poc/fork/*.patch` instead.

### The kernel driver: a special case, already solved more robustly

The directory `drivers/net/wireless/espressif/esp32-ng/` is not tracked by git
in the kernel repo (`git status` shows it as `??`), so a `git reset --hard`
does not touch it — but a full re-extraction of the kernel
(`make linux-dirclean && make linux-rebuild`, or any clean rebuild of the
profile) does overwrite it with the pristine version, without any warning.
**This actually happened once**: an `xipImage` in `images/` had been built with
the esp32-ng driver reverted to its pristine upstream version — the local
changes were silently missing, so the shipped kernel did not match the patch
this repo carries.

Fix (does not rely on "don't touch that folder"):
`configs/esp32s3_devkit_c1_16m_defconfig` now has
`BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH="board/espressif/esp32s3/patches/linux"`, buildroot's
native option for kernel patches — it re-applies itself after **every** kernel
extraction, no matter what triggers it. Verified with
`make linux-dirclean && make linux-patch`: the patches applied themselves, with
no manual intervention.

One more trap in the same area, found later: `apply-local-changes.sh` copies
`new-files/board/` over buildroot with `rsync -a` and **no `--delete`**, so a
patch deleted from this repo would linger in the buildroot tree and keep being
applied, and a renamed one would be applied twice under both names. A plain
`--delete` is not an option there (it would wipe buildroot's own `board/*`
profiles), so the script now removes
`build/buildroot/board/espressif/esp32s3/patches` before the rsync, which makes
that one directory match `new-files/` exactly.

## This session's incidents (why all this armor exists)

1. **Firmware, incident 1**: `keep_bootloader=y` was forgotten, `rm -rf
   build/esp-hosted` deleted 4 hand-edited files. They were rewritten from
   memory.
2. **Firmware, incident 2**: `esp_hosted_ng/esp/esp_driver/CMakeLists.txt` runs
   `git reset --hard` **unconditionally, on every `cmake .`** — it happens even
   with `keep_bootloader=y`. Fix: commit the changes directly in that repo
   (`git -c user.email=local@backup -c user.name=local-backup commit`, branch
   `ipc-5.1.1`, never pushed) so the reset lands on that commit, not on
   upstream. Now `apply-local-changes.sh esp-hosted` does this automatically.
3. **Kernel driver, incident 3** (found today, subtler): the directory is not
   tracked, so it survives `git reset --hard`, but does **not** survive a full
   re-extraction (`linux-dirclean` or fresh clone). It happened silently in some
   rebuild of the 16m profile without being noticed — the kernel compiled fine
   anyway (it compiles fine without AP too). It was discovered while auditing
   the Docker build's reproducibility, not through a visible failure. Fix:
   `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH`, see above.
4. **Container, incident 4**: buildroot needs `cpio`, and the Dockerfile never
   installed it. It is checked in `support/dependencies/`, i.e. *after*
   crosstool-NG has compiled the entire toolchain, so the build died hours in,
   at its most expensive point. `file` and `bzip2` were missing for the same
   reason. Fix: install them.
5. **Patches, incident 5** (the dangerous one):
   `03-buildroot-tracked-changes.patch` carried a compiled binary recorded as
   `Binary files ... differ` with an abbreviated index. `git apply` cannot
   reconstruct that, and it is atomic, so the patch was rejected **in full** on
   every fresh clone — and `apply-local-changes.sh` read "does not apply" as
   "already applied" and carried on. The build reported success while producing
   an image with no `/etc/fstab`, no `inetd.conf` and no `S05home`. Fix: drop
   from the patch everything `new-files/` already ships, and make the two cases
   distinguishable — a reverse check for "already applied", a hard error for
   anything else.
6. **Firmware, incident 6**: a from-scratch build reached the MMC host and
   stopped dead — no panic, no output. The kernel's RSA driver opens with an
   unbounded `while (readl(rsa + RSA_QUERY_CLEAN) != 1)`, waiting on a clock it
   deliberately never enables: the firmware hands the block over with
   `periph_module_enable(PERIPH_RSA_MODULE)`. That line,
   `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_HARDWARE_MPI=n`, the entire BLE link (patch 05 existed;
   nothing ever applied it) and a one-symbol ESP-IDF change were all in the
   working tree and in no patch here. Fix: regenerate the firmware patch
   straight from that tree, and verify the reconstruction byte for byte.
   **The wait loop had no timeout; `06-kernel-rsa-timeout.patch` gave it 100 ms.**
7. **Config, incident 7**: two things the released image had only by accident of
   a hand-edited, incremental `target/`. `setup-home.sh` was missing from
   `BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT`, so root landed in `/root`, on the read-only
   cramfs, instead of the writable jffs2. And buildroot's wpa_supplicant package
   installs its own `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`: a network block with no ssid and
   `key_mgmt=NONE`, which matches **any** open network — a clean build joined a
   carrier hotspot by itself. `make-images.sh` waved it through because its check
   looked only for `psk=`, and an open-network block has no credentials in it at
   all. Fix: `no-open-wifi.sh` at post-build, and a second check in
   `make-images.sh`.
8. **Kernel config, incident 8**: `experiments/mmu-poc/fork/build-kernel.sh`
   copies the configured buildroot tree into `experiments/mmu-poc/out/linux-fork`
   **only when that directory does not exist**, and the directory is gitignored,
   so it outlives `git checkout`, `git reset --hard` and branch switches alike.
   A line added to `devkit_c1_16m_linux.config` therefore reaches buildroot's
   kernel and never reaches the one that ships: the fork kernel rebuilds from
   the old `.config`, the compile succeeds, the size is measured, and the image
   goes out with the change missing. Nothing fails — that is the whole problem.
   And `build-kernel-reclaim.sh`, which is what `build/container-build.sh`
   actually calls, re-runs `build-kernel.sh` only when the reclaim patch is not
   yet applied, so on a warm tree the copy step is never even reached. Fix:
   `check-kernel-config.py` compares every statement of the seed config against
   the built `.config` and aborts — in `build-kernel.sh`, in
   `build-kernel-reclaim.sh` ahead of the compile, and in `package-final.py`
   against the artifact itself. Recovery is
   `rm -rf experiments/mmu-poc/out/linux-fork`, which the error prints.

9. **Kernel config, incident 9**: `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="regulatory.db
   regulatory.db.p7s"` was added so cfg80211 stops asking for a file that is
   not mounted yet, and the blobs were wired into
   `experiments/mmu-poc/fork/build-kernel.sh` — the path that was being tested
   at the time. Buildroot's own kernel build was never given them. It is not a
   warning: the kernel opens those files directly, so a clean build ran for 25
   minutes and then stopped with `No rule to make target
   'firmware/regulatory.db'`, and with `-j8` the real line was 370 lines above
   the one make printed last. Buildroot already makes `linux` depend on
   `wireless-regdb`, so the files existed the whole time, in
   `$(TARGET_DIR)/lib/firmware`; nothing copied them into
   `$(LINUX_DIR)/firmware` where the kernel looks. Fix: a
   `LINUX_PRE_BUILD_HOOKS` entry in `03-buildroot-tracked-changes.patch`, and
   `ExtraFirmwareTests` in `build/test-kernel-config.py`, which fails when a
   name in `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE` is missing from either build path. The
   general shape is incident 8 again: two kernel build paths, one of them
   updated.

10. **Fork backend, incident 10**: `mm/nommu-bank.inc` is compiled twice --
   into the kernel, and natively under ASan by
   `experiments/mmu-poc/fork/test-reclaim.py`, which is how the banking logic
   gets tested at all. `switch-latency.patch` added `get_ccount()`, the Xtensa
   cycle counter, inside `nommu_bank_switch`. The kernel has it; the host does
   not, and the shim compiles with `-Werror`, so the build stopped 34 minutes
   in on `implicit declaration of function 'get_ccount'`. Anything
   architecture-specific added to that file needs a stub in the shim beside
   `local_irq_save` and `READ_ONCE`. The stub advances a counter by 240 cycles
   per read, so the timing around the interrupts-off region is exercised on
   the host too rather than merely compiling.

11. **Fork backend, incident 11**: `swap-banks.patch` corrupts memory on the
   board and is now off by default. A clean build of `1af3a5b` took `Illegal
   instruction in kernel` in `sys_stat64` with the PC pointing at ASCII text on
   one boot, an `Oops` at `__rb_erase_color` under `exit_mmap -> delete_vma` on
   another, and on a third the login bash declared itself restricted and exited.
   All three are one process's pages turning up inside another, which is what
   this patch moves around. Eight plain resets on an initialised board produced
   none of it: the trigger is load, and the first boot after a flash -- where
   `home-init` populates a freshly formatted `/home` -- hits it reliably enough
   to wedge the console. `test-reclaim.py` passes against both models, so the
   defect is not in the page bookkeeping that test covers; the likely gap is
   what it cannot model, such as two VMAs of one mm sharing a `vm_region`,
   which would have `nommu_bank_switch()` exchange the same region twice.
   `FORK_SWAP_BANKS=1` builds it back in.

12. **Measurement, incident 12**: the first soak runner called a boot "ok"
   when nothing in its fault list matched -- including boots that never
   reached the login prompt -- and its list missed `Illegal Instruction in
   'sleep'` and busybox's `Caught unhandled exception`. On that basis the 0.7
   release was declared clean (0/5) and user space "ruled out"; both were
   wrong. With the corrected classifier the 0.7 kernel faults in about one
   factory boot in ten, so the corruption predates this batch and this batch
   made it more frequent. And 0/5 says little anyway: at a true rate of 20%
   it happens a third of the time. `build/soak-boot.py` now has three states,
   passes only on the login prompt plus the last init script, prints a 95%
   upper bound, and has its own host tests. Ten rounds minimum before
   reading anything into a zero; twenty to compare two variants.
13. **Environment, incident 13**: `/tmp` is a 16 GiB tmpfs shared by every
   session; copies of the kernel's `drivers/` tree in a scratch directory
   filled it, after which every shell command returned exit 1 with no output
   -- the shell could not write its own transcript. Nothing in the repo was
   damaged, but two edits were silently lost and a patch was regenerated
   from a half-applied tree. Keep scratch trees under `build-output/`, which
   is on disk and ignored by git.
14. **Flash protocol, incident 14** (found in a review of the
   flash path): `drivers/mtd/chips/map_esp32.c` shares one command object with
   core 0 and nothing serialised its users -- MTD provides no exclusion and
   `/etc` and `/home` are two jffs2 superblocks. XIP reads had no lock at all,
   while core 0 disables the flash cache to write, so a read from another task
   during a write returned whatever the cache held. A user-space `sleep` took
   an illegal instruction on a legal XIP instruction with `PS.UM` set, which
   is what that looks like. `07-kernel-flash-ipc-lock.patch` puts one mutex
   around erase, write and read. The same review found `recycle_cmd_node`
   after teardown (a regression of patch 05, reverted), the TX completion
   pass gated on a successful RX (`08-kernel-ipc-tx-completion.patch`), the
   jffs2 patch trusting a default (`compr=zlib` now refuses), `home-init`
   publishing a seed whose gzip failed after streaming, and `S03keepconfig`
   restoring an old password over a new one. All are fixed and tested on the
   host; the board-side effect is measured with the soak runner.

15. **Fork backend, incident 15 -- closed in 15b below; kept as the trail**: with a byte-exact rebuild of the
   0.7 kernel config (recovered from a kept build tree), the same firmware and
   the same rootfs, ten factory boots each, measured with the corrected soak
   runner: fork backend on, 3 FAIL + 5 INCONCLUSIVE of 10; fork backend off,
   1 FAIL + 7 PASS of 10; the 0.7 release itself, 1 FAIL of 10 (a user-space
   `Illegal Instruction` the old runner could not see). The flash mutex
   (patch 07) and the WiFi/IPC fixes (05, 08) do not move the rate with fork
   on (4 of 4). The faults land anywhere: `slab_caches` walked into a bad
   pointer at 147 ms, the DTB at 393 ms, `kmalloc` from `pinctrl` at 735 ms,
   `add_nommu_region` on a duplicate `vm_start` at 10 s, a `kworker`
   dereferencing `-4` in `kernfs_notify_workfn` at 3.2 s. The first three are
   before any process exists, so `nommu_bank_switch()` cannot have run yet;
   whatever the fork backend does to make this four times more likely, it is
   not only its context-switch copy. Ruled out with experiments: the PSRAM
   (`memtest=4`, clean), a kernel stack overflow (canary never tripped,
   >5 KiB free), `SLUB_TINY`, the jffs2 and WiFi driver patches, the RSA
   patch, the seven config symbols, the embedded `regulatory.db`, the
   firmware watchdogs, the firmware's own PSRAM memtest (it lowers the rate,
   does not clear it), the cross-core IPC interrupt level (1, masked), and the
   space the kernel puts in the shared vectors page (fits). A canary of free
   RAM could not be tried: the fault arrives before `late_initcall`. Turning
   the backend off is not an option -- bash, dtach, make and micropython link
   against `libfork.so.0`. `CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE` with everything else equal:
   2 FAIL, 5 PASS, 3 INCONCLUSIVE of 10, against 4 FAIL of 4 with
   `CONFIG_PREEMPT`; the seed config now has it, as a mitigation with the
   number beside it, not as the fix. Next: a canary that starts in
   `mm_core_init`, in internal SRAM. Reproduce with `build/soak-boot.py`,
   twenty rounds.
   **2026-09-13, the shipping image**: twenty rounds on the image built clean
   from `24f0faf` (`build/verification/2026-09-13-full-image.md`) -- 20 PASS,
   0 FAIL. Two differences make it not a like-for-like answer to the 2 above.
   The kernel is the whole current configuration, not 0.7's config with debug
   symbols, so no single change can be credited. And every measurement above
   booted with `no_hash_pointers` and **no `quiet`**, while the shipping image
   has `quiet`: the console then carries KERN_ERR and worse only, so the
   user-space `Illegal Instruction` (`pr_info_ratelimited`,
   `arch/xtensa/kernel/traps.c:371`) that caught the 0.7 release, and the
   KERN_WARNING `WARNING: CPU` and `list_del corruption`, were in the ring
   buffer and not on the wire. What the twenty rounds do establish is no
   Oops, panic or `BUG:` -- KERN_EMERG and KERN_ALERT print through `quiet` --
   and no user-space crash message. `soak-boot.py` now reads `dmesg` and
   `/proc/sys/kernel/tainted` back after every login and runs the fault list
   over them, so the next run measures the same on either command line. Open.

15b. **Incident 15, CLOSED. Root cause: the flash cache is never invalidated after
   a write, and the soak resets the board mid-write.** Found the day after
   twenty clean factory boots, when the same kernel byte for byte
   (`xipImage` `48713c61…`) took faults in 10 of 17. The only change to the
   image was `bootlog`, two overlay scripts; a controlled run with the
   previous rootfs on the same kernel took an Oops at **478 ms**, before
   `/sbin/init` exists, so no script is involved and reverting `bootlog`
   changes nothing. Transcripts in `build/verification/2026-09-14-flash-read/`.

   **What the Oops says.** `check_lifetime+0x9` faulted on `l32i a5, a4, 0`
   right after `l32r a4, 0x422c84d8`: a load from the kernel's literal pool,
   which lives in `.text`, which under `CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL` is executed
   straight out of the flash through the cache. The literal should be
   `0x3d824000` (`jiffies_64`); the register held `0x821503a0`, which is
   `worker_thread+0xd8` with bit 31 set -- a windowed-ABI `call8` return
   address. A cache read returned data that was never at that address. The
   same day's round 15 is the same shape (`rcu_process_callbacks` handing
   `memcpy` a NULL out of a callback record), and so is every early fault
   in the list above. The PSRAM memtest was clean because the PSRAM is not
   where this happens.

   **The cause, in the firmware.** The ESP32-S3 has one flash cache shared
   by both cores (`SOC_IDCACHE_PER_CORE` is not defined for it). Linux reads
   jffs2 straight through that cache -- `map_esp32_read()` is
   `map_copy_from()` on the `0x42xxxxxx` mapping, and `_point` hands jffs2
   pointers into it -- and writes by IPC to core 0, which is the only side
   that can program the flash. After a write, ESP-IDF's
   `flash_end_flush_cache` → `spi_flash_check_and_flush_cache()`
   (`components/spi_flash/flash_mmap.c:355`) invalidates the cache for the
   written page **only if `esp_mmu_paddr_find_caps()` knows that physical
   address**. It knows what ESP-IDF mapped. It does not know `linux`,
   `rootfs`, `etc` or `home`: the boot banner says so --
   `MMU: first_free_mmu=10 (firmware uses entries 0..9)` -- Linux programs
   entries 14 and 0x54 upward behind ESP-IDF's back. So for every write
   Linux ever makes the invalidation is skipped, and on the S3 there is a
   second, upstream bug on top: `is_page_mapped_in_cache()` computes
   `vaddr` into a local and never stores it through `out_ptr`, so
   `cache_hal_invalidate_addr()` is not reached even for pages it does
   know. **Nothing invalidates the flash cache after a jffs2 write.**

   Two things follow. jffs2 writes a node, then reads the page back -- to
   verify, to rescan, to serve the file -- and gets the version from
   *before* the write out of the cache: that is the `gzip: crc error`, the
   `Bad page state`, the `sh: syntax error: unexpected )` from a script in
   `/etc`, and the `bash: [: : integer expression expected` at a login the
   runner had been about to count as clean. And the cache is 16 KB of
   instructions and 32 KB of data, 8-way, shared: a stale jffs2 line
   sitting in the same set as a kernel literal is a kernel that reads its
   own text wrong. Every fault lands in the window where `home-init` is
   doing hundreds of jffs2 writes, and the fork backend multiplies the rate
   because every context switch is a burst of cache traffic.

   **Why the "early" faults, before any write.** The soak restores `/etc`
   and `/home` with `--after hard_reset`, so the board boots and starts
   `home-init` -- and then the runner opens the port, which resets the
   board through DTR/RTS in the middle of that. The boot it observes is the
   second one, over a `/home` that was being written when the power went.
   `slab_caches` at 147 ms, the DTB at 393 ms, `add_nommu_region` on a
   duplicate `vm_start`: the kernel building structures out of half-written
   jffs2. Both faces are the one cause. (An earlier draft of this entry
   said a software reset leaves the cache dirty; it does not --
   `bootloader_esp32s3.c:182` calls `cache_hal_init()` on every boot. That
   sentence was wrong and is withdrawn.)

   **Why the numbers moved without a fix.** `SLUB_TINY`, `PREEMPT_NONE`,
   the firmware memtest and the rest all change how much cache traffic the
   boot generates and therefore how often a stale line gets hit. None of
   them touches the cause, which is why none of them cleared it. And why
   0 of 20 one day and 10 of 17 the next on the same bytes: the hit is
   probabilistic over cache state, and a run of twenty is not that large.

   **Not thermal.** The board had been through fifty-odd flash rewrites
   when it went bad and that looked like heat; it is not, because the fault
   is reproducible from cold with the same writes, and because the
   mechanism is in the code.

   **The fix**, in the firmware's `linux_flash.c` (now in
   `patches/02-firmware-network-adapter.patch`): after the write or erase
   and before `local_state = DONE`, `Cache_Invalidate_Addr(0x42000000 +
   cmd->addr, cmd->size)` -- the ROM call, which takes a virtual address and
   does not ask who mapped it. Not `cache_hal_invalidate_addr()`, whose
   `HAL_ASSERT` checks the range against the same MMU accounting that does
   not know these partitions. The whole flash is identity-mapped for Linux
   at `0x42000000`, so the virtual address is the flash offset plus that.
   The soak runner stops resetting a board mid-write: `--after no_reset`,
   and one deliberate reset over EN once the port is listening.

   **Measured.** Same kernel, same rootfs, same `/etc` and `/home`
   artifacts as the 10-of-17 run an hour earlier. With the patched firmware
   and the fixed runner: first five rounds **5 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0
   INCONCLUSIVE**, every one logging in and reading `dmesg` and the taint
   flags back clean. The twenty-round run is in
   `build/verification/2026-09-14-cache-fix.md`. Two things changed at once
   (firmware and runner), so this does not say how much each contributed;
   it says the pair takes the rate from ten in seventeen to nought in five
   on the same bytes, which no configuration change in the whole history
   of this incident came near.

16. **Fork backend, incident 16**: the bank swap was given a proper try and
   still loses. An external audit of the two models side by side found four
   real defects, all in `nommu_bank_switch()`, which runs inside
   `context_switch()` under the runqueue lock with interrupts off: its guards
   called `printk` from there (waking the console thread, which re-enters the
   scheduler), went silent after the first hit, and returned with the page
   contents already swapped and the ownership assignment still to come -- one
   refusal handed live memory to the wrong process permanently; one arm called
   `free_page()` from there, which the copy model never does; freed pointers
   were left in a live descriptor's `pages[]`, which in this model is the
   owner's normal state; and nothing stopped two banks for one region in one
   mm, which would make a single switch pass swap that region twice. All four
   are fixed in `swap-banks.patch`, and the first fix for the second one was
   wrong in an instructive way: leaving the region ownerless makes every later
   fork of it fail, so init hung on its first one and **nought of ten boots
   reached a login**. The pages now go on an orphan list that fork and exit
   drain.
   With all of that, ten factory boots against ten of the copy model on the
   same kernel: swap 2 FAIL / 1 PASS / 7 INCONCLUSIVE, copy 2 FAIL / 5 PASS /
   3 INCONCLUSIVE. The inconsistency latch **never fired**, so the page
   bookkeeping stayed correct throughout -- the swap model is now internally
   sound and still roughly four times more likely to leave the board wedged.
   It stayed behind `FORK_SWAP_BANKS=1` for a week. The difference that was
   left -- the copy model keeps every process's memory in two places and the
   swap model in one, so the incident-15 corruption was survivable under copy
   and fatal under swap -- turned out to be the whole story. **Closed
   2026-09-14, in the swap's favour**: with incident 15 fixed in the firmware,
   twenty factory boots with the swap on, 20 clean, latch never fired,
   `ForkSwitchMax` 13.8-14.3 ms in every round. It is the default now.

## What's here

- `patches/00-esp32-linux-build.patch` — changes to upstream's build driver
  `rebuild-esp32s3-linux-wifi.sh`: the two `apply-local-changes.sh` calls that
  make the build reproduce this project (see "How the pieces fit"), the
  optional gcc-14 shim and `CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM` host-tool
  workarounds, and hostapd disabled. Verified to apply with `patch -p1` to a
  fresh clone of `jcmvbkbc/esp32-linux-build`, both on a host and inside the
  Docker image.
- The kernel patches live in
  `new-files/board/espressif/esp32s3/patches/linux/` (`01-` RSA, `02-` BLE,
  `03-` cmdline and on), which is what `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH` points at and
  what is applied automatically. `01-kernel-esp32s3-rsa-crypto.patch` adds the
  hardware RSA accelerator driver (`drivers/crypto/esp32s3_rsa.c`, 549 lines)
  plus its `obj-y` line. Verified to apply cleanly with `patch -p1` and to
  reproduce the exact driver that the shipped `xipImage` was built from. A
  second, byte-identical copy of this one patch used to sit under top-level
  `patches/`, tracked separately with nothing to keep the two in sync; that
  copy is gone. There also used to be a fourth patch here,
  `01-kernel-esp32ng-ap-support.patch`, carrying the SoftAP; it is gone, and
  with it the only reason the esp32-ng driver diverged from upstream beyond
  the BLE pipe. The remaining files keep their names so existing references
  stay valid. Top-level `patches/` has its own gaps for the same reason: only
  `00`, `02` and `03` remain.
- `new-files/board/espressif/esp32s3/package-patches/` is
  `BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR`: Buildroot applies `<package>/*.patch` on top of its
  own for that package. BusyBox gets private home directories and a separate
  environment per cron job; dropbear gets `-n`, which turns public key logins
  off for `remote-login auth password`, since dropbear has no switch for it.
  `linux/linux.hash` pins the kernel.org tarball.
- `flash.sh` — flashes a bare board from `images/` with nothing but `esptool`
  (see "Flash directly" above).
- `patches/02-firmware-network-adapter.patch` — every change to the ESP32
  firmware (`esp-hosted/esp_hosted_ng/esp/esp_driver/network_adapter/`): the
  SoftAP authenticator, the BLE provisioning link, and the handover of the RSA
  accelerator to Linux. Generated straight from the tree the shipped image was
  built from, so it reproduces it byte for byte. Applied automatically by
  `apply-local-changes.sh esp-hosted`.
- `patches/03-buildroot-tracked-changes.patch` — a single consolidated
  `git diff` of all tracked files modified under `build/buildroot/`
  (busybox.config, inetd.conf, wpa_supplicant.conf.example, both defconfigs).
  Replaces the old `03-buildroot-board-config.patch` and
  `04-nat-dns-security-buildroot.patch` / `05-ssh-idle-timeout.patch`, which
  overlapped each other and are no longer maintained. Applied automatically by
  `apply-local-changes.sh buildroot`.
- `kernel-driver-esp32-ng/` — a complete reference/human-readable copy of
  `drivers/net/wireless/espressif/esp32-ng/` (pristine upstream plus the BLE
  pipe; STA only, no AP code at all); the patch above is what is actually used
  in the automated flow, this is a readable backup.
- `new-files/` — an exact mirror of what has to be copied: `board/` and
  `configs/` go over `build/buildroot/` (automatic via
  `apply-local-changes.sh buildroot`); `esp-hosted/network_adapter/*.16m8r`
  (partition table + sdkconfig for the 16 MB profile, new files the firmware
  patch does not cover since it is a `git diff` of only `main/`) go over
  `build/esp-hosted/esp_hosted_ng/esp/esp_driver/network_adapter/` (automatic
  via `apply-local-changes.sh esp-hosted`); `toplevel/` holds the pieces that go
  next to upstream's build driver — `apply-local-changes.sh` and
  `devkit-c1-16m.conf` (upstream only ships an 8MB profile) — plus the
  `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`.

## Applying the changes by hand

Normally not needed — the build driver calls `apply-local-changes.sh` itself.
This is the equivalent by hand, from inside the `esp32-linux-build` clone, with
`$REPO` pointing at a checkout of this repository:

```bash
REPO=/path/to/Linux-on-esp32-S3

patch -p1 < "$REPO/patches/00-esp32-linux-build.patch"   # if not applied yet

cd build/buildroot
git apply "$REPO/patches/03-buildroot-tracked-changes.patch"
cp -a "$REPO"/new-files/board/* board/
cp -a "$REPO"/new-files/configs/* configs/
cd ../..

cd build/esp-hosted/esp_hosted_ng
git apply "$REPO/patches/02-firmware-network-adapter.patch"
cp "$REPO"/new-files/esp-hosted/network_adapter/*.16m8r \
   esp/esp_driver/network_adapter/
git add esp/esp_driver/network_adapter/
git -c user.email="local@backup" -c user.name="local-backup" \
  commit -m "network_adapter: this project's firmware (local-only, never push)"
cd ../../..

cp "$REPO/new-files/toplevel/devkit-c1-16m.conf" .
```

The kernel driver applies itself via `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH` once the defconfig
above is in place — no additional manual step is required.

**Historical 0.6 status: validated on real hardware.** That combined image was flashed to a
fully erased ESP32-S3 (N16R8) and it boots to a login prompt, the RSA
accelerator passes its 512- and 2048-bit self-tests, the rootfs mounts from
flash via XIP, and telnet comes up. Working: serial console, telnet, STA WiFi
with internet (the interactive `wifi` command scans and connects), hardware
RSA, the nano editor, Lua, an opt-in BusyBox httpd, and curl (HTTP solid,
HTTPS with real certificate verification but experimental — see above). The
board is STA only — there is no SoftAP.

That release's patch/clone flow was reproduced against fresh clones, and the full
multi-hour compile has been run inside the container with the result booting on
hardware. That first claim was made here once before it was true; it is not
being made again without a booting board behind it.
