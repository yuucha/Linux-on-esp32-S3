# Changelog

Releases carry one flashable `.bin` for a 16 MB / 8 MB-PSRAM ESP32-S3. Full
notes and the binaries are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/paulneja/Linux-on-esp32-S3/releases).

## 0.9.1 — a crash over SSH, and SSH on your own port (2026-10-05)

Fixes the kernel crash some logins over SSH ended in, and lets SSH, Telnet
and the web page move to other ports, with SSH taking a password, a key or
both. Measured on the images in `images/`: **36 board tests, 0 failed**, 11
more beyond the suite (11/11), **20 factory boots, 20 clean**, SSH with a
pty, and SSH on another port in all three modes, Telnet and the web page on
other ports, from the host over WiFi. MemAvailable is 4248 kB at the start
of the suite. The kernel is the
[linux-esp32s3](https://github.com/paulneja/linux-esp32s3) tag
`v7.2.4-esp32s3.3`.

- **A kernel crash when logging in over SSH from kitty (#22).** On NOMMU the
  kernel copies a new program's arguments and environment to the top of its
  stack, and the FDPIC loader sized that stack only by what the program
  declares: 16 KiB for BusyBox, 32 KiB for the rest. kitty's `ssh` kitten
  runs a large bootstrap script through `sh`, and each hush subshell
  re-executes itself with every shell variable as an argument, so the copy
  ran past the bottom of the stack and over kernel memory. The crash then
  showed up later and somewhere else: a VMA tree when a process exited, or
  jffs2's node lists. Kernel patch 62 adds the size of the arguments to the
  stack. A `sh` with a 30 KiB variable and one subshell brought the 0.9
  kernel down on its second try; with the patch, 35 runs with 30, 60 and
  120 KiB passed, and MemAvailable after boot did not move.
- **SSH and Telnet ports, and how SSH lets you in.** `remote-login port
  ssh|telnet N` moves either one, `remote-login auth password|both|key`
  picks what SSH accepts, and `remote-login status` shows all of it. The
  settings are kept in `/etc/remote-login.conf`, which can be edited by hand
  and applied with `remote-login apply`, and they survive an update with the
  rest of the configuration. Key-only is dropbear's own `-s`; password-only
  needed a small dropbear patch, `-n`, since dropbear has no switch to turn
  public keys off. `ssh-server on|off` now goes through the same settings.
- **`web-server port N`** moves the web page off port 80. The server's line
  in inetd.conf is found by its program now, not by the port number.
- **More tests.** On the host: `remote-login`, `ssh-server` and
  `web-server`; the saved clock, the NTP hook, BLE provisioning, the USB
  console login and `use-shell`; CI runs these and the `bootlog`, bash vfork
  and soak classifier tests that existed but were not run. On the board:
  `build/test-network-services.py` checks the ports and all three SSH modes
  from the host, and the extra tests re-execute a subshell with 30 KiB of
  arguments. The script tests can also run under the image's own BusyBox
  hush (`build/host-hush.sh`, `BOARD_SH`), and CI runs them that way too:
  hush exits a `set -e` script when a `while read` loop ends, which is how
  the first `remote-login port` worked on the host and did nothing on the
  board. What ran on which bytes is in
  [`build/verification/2026-10-05-fix-22.md`](build/verification/2026-10-05-fix-22.md).

## 0.9.0 — Linux 7.2.4, and fork through the cache MMU (2026-10-04)

The kernel moves from 6.11 to 7.2.4 and becomes this project's own tree,
fork() gets several times cheaper, and a freshly flashed board has nothing
listening on the network until someone logs in. Measured on the images in
`images/`: **36 board tests, 0 failed**, ten more beyond the suite (10/10),
**20 factory boots, 20 clean**, 100 `ip link` down/up cycles and 25
`wifi connect` in a row, and SSH with a pty. WiFi setup over Bluetooth from a
phone and an update from 0.8.1 that kept the password and the WiFi were
checked on an earlier build of the same kernel. MemAvailable is 4204 kB at
the start of the suite, against 3708 kB in 0.8.1.

### Kernel

- **Linux 7.2.4 instead of 6.11.** 6.11 stopped getting fixes at the end of
  2024. The kernel now comes from the kernel.org tarball, with its checksum
  pinned in `build/sources.lock`, plus a series of 61 patches kept in this
  repository, instead of a branch of linux-xtensa. The port brings back the
  ESP32 serial drivers that 7.1 removed upstream, follows the API changes in
  GPIO, cfg80211, the interrupt matrix probe and workqueues, and keeps
  `PREEMPT_NONE`, which 7.x hides unless the platform asks for it. The same
  tree, with every commit and its author, is published as
  [linux-esp32s3](https://github.com/paulneja/linux-esp32s3); this release
  ships its tag `v7.2.4-esp32s3.2`.
- **Fourteen commits nobody here used left the series:** TRAX, the classic
  ESP32 variant, USB, the BOX-3 and KC705 boards, fbtft and perf.
- **A smaller kernel.** Netfilter, IPv6, perf events, suspend, MMC and FAT,
  the block layer, socket diagnostics, policy routing, rfkill and cramfs on
  block devices are off; nothing on the board used them. BusyBox drops IPv6
  as well, and the printk buffer is 16 KiB, twice what a boot writes.
  `xipImage` goes from 2,982,472 to 2,419,056 bytes. `test-board.py` reads
  the flash through `/dev/mtdN` now that there is no block layer.
- The timer showed 0 interrupts in `/proc/interrupts` on 7.x, because it was
  not marked per-CPU; it is now. `panic_print=0x20` became
  `panic_console_replay`, since 7.x warns about the old name at every boot.

### fork()

- **The bank exchange ran with interrupts off.** Swapping up to 512 KiB took
  21.5 ms with the tick, the UART and the IPC to core 0 all held off. It now
  happens in `finish_arch_post_lock_switch()`, after the runqueue lock is
  dropped and with interrupts on. With three busy forked shells the timer
  delivers 101 interrupts a second at HZ=100.
- **Aligned 64 KiB chunks are exchanged through the cache MMU.** Linux's RAM
  is PSRAM mapped in 64 KiB pages, so instead of copying a chunk and its
  shadow word by word, the switch writes both back from the cache, swaps
  their two MMU entries and invalidates them: about 80 µs per chunk against
  3.8 ms. `fork_bank_mmu=0` turns it off, `ForkMmuSwapped` in
  `/proc/meminfo` counts what it moved, and writing 0 to the
  `fork_bank_switch_max` parameter clears `ForkSwitchMax`.
- **malloc grows the heap 64 KiB at a time.** uClibc extended it 4 KiB at a
  time, and each extension was a separate mapping too small for the MMU, so
  most of a shell's heap still went word by word. With a local uClibc-ng
  patch, applied through crosstool-NG, the heap comes in aligned 64 KiB
  mappings, and malloc falls back to the exact size when no 64 KiB block is
  free. On the release image, with `fork_bank_mmu` off and then on, the
  worst context switch with three busy Bash processes goes from 29.3 ms to
  5.2 to 5.6 ms, and with four forked MicroPython processes holding 192 KiB
  each, from 33.5 ms to 9.3 to 9.6 ms. The data of shared libraries
  is still copied, since those mappings are a few KiB each. The larger heap
  steps cost about 276 kB of MemAvailable at boot.
- **The 512 KiB limit counts only what a switch copies.** With the heap in
  64 KiB steps, a Bash that had been running for a while held 556 to 576 KiB
  of private memory and could no longer fork (`Cannot allocate memory`).
  `fork_bank_max_bytes` (512 KiB) now applies to the copied part only, and
  `fork_bank_max_total` (2 MiB) caps the whole bank. On the release image a
  Bash holding 1.3 MB of private memory forks three children; the slowest
  switch is then 17 ms, because more of that memory is copied.
- `mmu-run` and `mmu-probe` expected the PSRAM pages in order in the cache
  MMU table. After a switch through the MMU they are in any order, so
  `mmu-run` refused to start; both now accept any permutation and read the
  real entry of each page.

### WiFi

- **A wrong password left the board unable to scan (#20).** `wpa_supplicant`
  kept retrying the network, and while it authenticates the firmware refuses
  a scan (`cmd_scan_request ... ret: -1`) or the kernel answers busy. It
  recovered only when the retry backoff left a gap, minutes later. Killing
  `wpa_supplicant` made the next scan work at once, which is what confirmed
  it on the board. `wpa_supplicant` now logs to `/run/wpa_supplicant.log`;
  `wifi connect` reads it, says "Wrong password" (exit status 2) and stops the
  retries, `wifi status` says the last attempt failed, and a scan stops a
  wrong-password loop before it starts. Over Bluetooth the phone is told the
  password was wrong instead of "got no IP". On the board: a wrong password
  is reported in 19 s and the scan right after it works, five times in a row;
  the right one gets an address in 13 s.

### Logging in

- **Nothing listens on the network until the first login.** Telnet used to
  be on from the factory with `changeme123`, and a board joined to WiFi over
  Bluetooth was reachable with it before anyone had touched the console. The
  first root login now asks for a new password, refuses the factory one, and
  then asks whether to turn on SSH, Telnet or neither. Only that one is
  turned on. `remote-login ssh|telnet|off|status` switches later;
  `ssh-server on` can still add SSH next to Telnet by hand. An update keeps
  the choice, and a board coming from 0.8.1 is asked once.
- **The board tests leave the factory login behind.** The harness answers
  the first login itself, so after `./run.sh` the board used to keep the
  test password with SSH on. `build/factory-login.py` now runs after the
  suite and puts back `changeme123`, nothing listening and the first-login
  questions.
- **`passwd` stores SHA-256 hashes.** BusyBox defaulted to MD5 crypt, so the
  factory password was SHA-256 but every password set on the board,
  including the one the first login asks for, was MD5. The first login also
  recognizes the factory password in any of the formats, which it did not
  when the tests put it back with MD5.

### Not fixed yet

- Boot to login averages 15.1 s over 20 factory boots, against 14.2 s on
  0.8.1. Where the extra second goes is not tracked down yet.
- Once in about 60 runs, the `hush-login` test sat at its prompt until the
  timeout. It has not come back since, and the cause is not known.

## 0.8.1 — WiFi that survives being poked, and a USB console (2026-09-23)

A fixes release. Everything below was found by a user issue or by pushing the
board harder than the 0.8 tests did, and each fix was checked on the board by
repeating what broke it. Measured on a clean build of the release commit:
**36 board tests, 0 failed**, ten more beyond the suite (10/10), **20 factory
boots, 20 clean** with `dmesg` and the taint flags read back, MemAvailable
3708 kB at the start of the suite against 3744 kB in 0.8.

### WiFi

- **The command queue race behind "WiFi doesn't connect and sometimes kernel
  panics" (#13).** A second command queued while the first was in flight
  sat with nothing to run it, timed out after five seconds, and was recycled
  onto the free list while still linked into the pending one, which
  cross-linked the two. `10-kernel-esp32ng-cmd-race.patch` takes it off the
  pending queue before recycling it and re-arms the worker when the current
  command clears. 100 `ip link set espsta0 down/up` in a row used to end in
  `Command[N] timed out` and a fault in the work queue; now they end clean.
- **With that fixed, the same 100 cycles hit a `BUG()` in cfg80211.** The
  driver's `ndo_stop` did nothing, so bringing the interface down during a
  scan left cfg80211 to finish the scan itself, free the request, and the
  driver to complete it again when the firmware answered: a use after free
  that ended in `wiphy_to_rdev()`. `11-kernel-esp32ng-scan-stop.patch`
  completes the scan in `esp_stop()`, before cfg80211 has to.
- **Every `wifi connect` leaked a DHCP client and about 100 kB.** The `wifi`
  script killed `wpa_supplicant` before `ifdown`, so the interface's own
  `pre-down killall wpa_supplicant` found nothing, failed, and `ifdown` gave
  up before stopping `udhcpc`, while still forgetting the interface was up.
  Twelve reconnects left thirteen `udhcpc`; 25 in a row ran the board out of
  memory. The `pre-down` can no longer fail, `wifi` takes the link down first
  and sweeps what is left, and the clock script stops the previous `ntpd -q`.
  25 reconnects now keep one `udhcpc` and a flat MemAvailable.

### SSH

- **`ssh root@board` got no terminal (#9).** Cross-compiling skipped dropbear's
  `/dev/ptmx` probe, so it fell back to scanning `/dev/pty??`, which this
  kernel does not build: "PTY allocation request failed". It uses `/dev/ptmx`
  now. `build/test-ssh-pty.py` checks it from the host over WiFi.
- **`kitten ssh` from kitty failed with no shell.** Its bootstrap unpacks a
  `tar.gz` with `tar xpzf`, and BusyBox tar was built without gzip support.
  `CONFIG_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_GZ` is on; the board still has no `xterm-kitty`
  terminfo, so kitty falls back to a plain terminal type.

### A console on the chip's own USB port (#17)

- The kernel console is mirrored to the USB Serial/JTAG port as `ttyGS3`,
  so a board plugged in by its native USB connector shows the boot log with
  no UART adapter. `/dev/console` and the main login stay on the UART. The
  firmware no longer claims that port as a secondary ESP-IDF console.
- A login there is off by default: a getty holding `ttyGS3` open costs about
  100 kB, most of it tty buffers in the kernel, cable or not. That was
  measured, 3528 kB against 3716 kB available at boot. `usb-console
  on|off|status` switches it and the setting survives a reboot. BusyBox init
  reads `inittab` before `/etc` is mounted, so `S47usbconsole` has it reread
  the writable copy.
- With nothing on the other end the port's FIFO never drains, and the
  console's busy-wait was bounded by `jiffies`, which do not advance with
  interrupts off. `12-kernel-esp32-acm-console-stall.patch` bounds it by the
  cycle counter and stops waiting on a port that has stalled once. 300
  kernel errors with the cable unplugged cost about 4 ms each and hang
  nothing.

### Build

- **`reproduce.sh` could fill the disk (#12).** Logs are capped at 50 MB each
  and the build checks for free space before it starts, not hours in.
- **The ESP-IDF Python environment was missing on a clean build (#16).**
  `container-build.sh` installs it explicitly.
- The container no longer receives the host's git identity, a GID that
  already exists in the image is handled (thanks @yuucha, #11), and
  `flash.sh` checks the image checksums before it erases anything.
- `kernel-driver-esp32-ng/` had drifted from the patches that build the
  kernel. It is back in sync, and CI fails if it drifts again.
- Patch 04 was a second copy of the RSA driver and is gone; patch 05 no
  longer carries a 984-line `main.c.orig`. The RSA driver wipes the key when
  it is freed (patch 09).

## 0.8 — the board stops crashing (2026-09-14)

Measured on the shipping image, built from a clean clone and read back off
the board: **MemAvailable 1340 kB to 3744 kB** at the same point of the same
suite, largest free contiguous block 2048 kB, **36 board tests, 0 failed**,
ten more beyond the suite, **10 factory boots, 10 clean**, `tainted` 0.
`build/verification/2026-09-14-final-image.md` has the hashes and the
per-program figures; the peak fork shadow of bash is 528 kB, half of what
the copy model needed.

Fifty-five factory boots on the fixed firmware, every one rewriting `/etc`
and `/home` first so the run repeats the load that provoked the corruption:
**55 clean**, each one logging in and reading `dmesg` and the taint flags
back, against ten faults in seventeen on the firmware before the fix. Two
independent builds of the commit differ in one file, `/etc/shadow`, whose
hash is salted per build. DEVELOPMENT.md incident 15 is closed with the
cause named; incident 16 closes in the exchange's favour.

### Stability

- **The memory corruption is found and fixed, and it was never memory.** The
  0.7 release faulted in about one factory boot in ten; this branch, before
  the fix, in about two; a kernel `Oops`, an `Illegal instruction`, a
  `gzip: crc error` from `home-init`, a script in `/etc` that suddenly had a
  syntax error, always in the seconds after `/home` is formatted. The
  ESP32-S3 has one flash cache for both cores. Linux reads jffs2 straight
  through it and writes by IPC to core 0, and core 0's post-write cache
  invalidation asks ESP-IDF's MMU accounting whether it knows the page --
  which it never does for a partition Linux mapped for itself. **Nothing
  invalidated the flash cache after any jffs2 write.** jffs2 read stale pages
  back; stale lines shared cache sets with kernel literals; the kernel read
  its own text wrong. The firmware now invalidates the exact range after every
  write and erase Linux asks for (`patches/02-firmware-network-adapter.patch`,
  `linux_flash.c`). DEVELOPMENT.md incident 15 has the whole trail, including
  the day it looked thermal and was not.
- The soak runner was making it worse: esptool's `--after hard_reset` started
  the board, `home-init` began writing, and opening the port reset it in the
  middle of that. The "faults before any process exists" were the second boot
  over a half-written `/home`. It now leaves the board in reset until the
  port is listening.
- `build/soak-boot.py` reproduces a factory boot in about a minute and
  classifies it as PASS, FAIL or INCONCLUSIVE on evidence, reading `dmesg`
  and the taint flags back rather than trusting a `quiet` console, with a
  95% bound on the fault rate.
- The flash driver's shared command object is under a mutex
  (`07-kernel-flash-ipc-lock.patch`) and the cross-core transmit completion
  runs whenever the write queue moved (`08-kernel-ipc-tx-completion.patch`).
  Both were real, neither was the corruption.

### Security

- **The four dropbear private host keys no longer ship in the image.** They
  come from buildroot's board directory, where they are tracked in a public
  repository, and they were landing in `rootfs.cramfs` at mode 0644 and in
  `etc.jffs2`. Every board built from this project answered SSH with the same
  key, downloadable by anyone. inetd already runs dropbear with `-R`, which
  writes a key per board into the writable `/etc` on the first connection.
  `package-final.py` now refuses to package an image that carries them.
- The WiFi configuration is written under `umask 077` instead of at 0644 with
  the passphrase in it until a later `chmod`, and the SSID and password are
  rejected if they contain a quote, a backslash or a newline. That path is
  reachable with no authentication at all from the BLE provisioning dialog.
- DHCP-supplied resolvers go into `resolv.conf` ahead of 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8,
  which had been written first, so every lookup went to a public resolver
  before the network's own and LAN names never resolved.
- `/var/log` points at `/run/log` rather than the 1777 `/tmp`, where syslogd
  created world-readable authentication records.
- `ble-wifi-setup` reads through `/run` instead of a predictable name in
  `/tmp`, times out instead of parking mid-dialog forever, and parses the scan
  list by tabs, so an SSID with two spaces or a `*` survives.
- The kernel drops `no_hash_pointers`, `/dev/mem` and `TIOCSTI`, and restricts
  `dmesg`.
- The WiFi driver no longer advertises WEP40, WEP104, TKIP and SMS4, and no
  longer dumps 1600 bytes of hex to the console for any packet with one header
  byte set — remotely triggerable, about two seconds of UART each.

### Memory

- `SLUB_TINY`, the allocator variant written for machines under 16 MiB. Slab
  went from 3692 kB to 1700 kB.
- `INET_TABLE_PERTURB_ORDER=8`: the source-port randomisation table was
  262144 bytes at boot, sized for a host making thousands of outbound
  connections.
- jffs2 stops reserving the zlib deflate workspace, which `CMODE_NONE` means
  is never entered. NOMMU has no vmalloc area — `mm/nommu.c` makes `vmalloc`
  a `kmalloc` — so it was an order-7 allocation: a contiguous 512 KiB block,
  which is the one thing a fork here cannot find.
- `LOG_BUF_SHIFT` 17 to 15, `LEGACY_PTYS` off, and `TICK_CPU_ACCOUNTING`
  instead of `VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN`, which pulls in a debugging option that
  adds work to every syscall return.
- tmpfs cannot be capped on this kernel, and the fstab now says why instead
  of pretending: `SHMEM` depends on MMU, so what answers to tmpfs is the
  tiny-shmem stub over ramfs, whose only mount option is `mode`. A `size=`
  is rejected and the filesystem is not mounted at all. Keep large files on
  `/home`.

### Fork

**The page-set exchange ships.** The backend gives every process its own
page set, including the resident one, whose set is dead weight because its
data is in the region itself. Exchanging the resident page with the incoming
shadow page lets N processes share N-1 sets at the same traffic per switch.
`programbench` measured it when it was first written -- socat 296 kB of peak
backup down to 144, micropython 512 to 384, dash 560 to 420, bash 892 to
800 -- and then it was switched off for a week because it corrupted memory.

It never had. The corruption was the firmware not invalidating the flash
cache after any write Linux made (DEVELOPMENT.md incident 15); every model
was reading stale pages, and this one, which keeps each process's memory in
one place rather than two, had nothing to survive that with. An external
audit had meanwhile found four real defects in its context-switch path, all
fixed, and an inconsistency latch went in that names any broken invariant.
With the firmware fixed: **twenty factory boots, 20 clean, the latch never
fired**, the exchange visibly at work in every one (`ForkSwitchMax` 13.8 to
14.3 ms). `build/verification/2026-09-14-swap.md`. `FORK_SWAP_BANKS=0`
builds the copy model instead.

Copy-on-write is not possible on this chip, and the reason is now written
down rather than remembered: the TRM's section 15.6 says an unpermitted write
*fails* and raises an asynchronous interrupt. There is no restartable fault to
copy a page and retry the store from.

`bank_access()` keeps interrupts disabled for one page instead of for a length
that comes from userspace — reading `/proc/PID/mem` of a banked process could
ask for a single 512 KiB memcpy with interrupts off. The ceiling on banked
private memory is a module parameter now; it also bounds how long a switch
runs with interrupts disabled.

### The WiFi driver

- A use after free on the interface creation error path: `esp_wdev` is
  `netdev_priv(ndev)` and was written after `free_netdev()`, with
  `adapter->priv[]` left pointing at it. That path is taken when a command to
  core 0 times out, which is when the firmware is slow at boot.
- The receive path copied a fixed 1600 bytes from an allocation the firmware
  sizes to the packet — 12 bytes for a short command response — reading past
  the end of the other core's heap. Its length check also added the header to
  a `u16` before comparing, so a declared length near 65535 passed.
- A command node handed out without an skb was never returned to the free
  queue, and every caller checks for the skb and gives up, so twenty
  allocation failures emptied the pool permanently and WiFi stayed dead until
  reboot. Two more leaks on the association and response paths.
- Transmit completion ran only when a receive in the same batch succeeded, so
  one failure with the write ring full could leave the queue stopped.
- `prepare_command_request()` rejects an oversized payload instead of reaching
  `skb_over_panic()`; the node then fits the transport maximum and drops from
  the kmalloc-4096 slab to kmalloc-2048.
- A `synchronize_rcu()` before every command, with no RCU readers to wait for.
- `esp_alloc_skb()` reserved headroom only when the slab returned an unaligned
  pointer, so transmit was allocating a second skb and copying every frame.

Twelve WiFi scans on the board with no node pool exhaustion; five networks
found.

### Core 0

- Both watchdogs are enabled. Nothing watched the WiFi and BLE core: if it
  deadlocked, Linux kept running with permanently dead networking and no way
  to reset it. Two traps, both found by building and reading the generated
  config: `CONFIG_INT_WDT`, the deprecated alias, sits 650 lines further down
  and silently turned the interrupt watchdog back off, and
  `ESP_INT_WDT_CHECK_CPU1` defaults to on, under which core 0 feeds the
  watchdog only after core 1's FreeRTOS tick sets a flag — core 1 runs Linux,
  so the chip would have reset itself every 1.6 s.
- `send_task` slept a whole tick when its queues were empty, adding up to
  10 ms to any packet arriving into an idle queue. The enqueue sites signal a
  semaphore instead.
- `SPIRAM_MEMTEST` no longer walks 8 MiB on every power-on.
- Enabling the watchdogs moves the firmware's `space_for_vectors` by a page,
  and the kernel is linked against that address, so `CONFIG_VECTORS_ADDR`
  moves with it. Flashing one without the other gives a core 0
  `StoreProhibited` panic and a reset loop; `package-final.py` compares them.
  The measured table is in the sdkconfig and in `build/verification/`.

### Flash

About 1.4 MB reclaimed from a rootfs partition that had 48 KB free: iptables
(788657 bytes, for a firewall that ships empty and that a post-build script
already renamed out of the boot sequence, whose plugins match on things this
kernel does not build), lua (223683 bytes, for one CGI now written in sh and
awk), the duplicate MicroPython and the untested payloads under
`/usr/share/mmu` (468 KB), the gpio tools that duplicate `espctl`, and four
libraries no ELF in the image lists as `NEEDED`. The kernel itself is 320 KB
smaller. One trade was tried and reverted: compressing busybox's help text
saves 45 KB of flash but makes every `--help` allocate about 450 KB of RAM
for bunzip2, in one contiguous block — `nc --help` went from 76 KB private to
584 KB on the board.

### Fork, part two

bash runs a plain foreground command through `vfork` now. `fork` reserved and
copied all 368 KiB of an interactive login, exchanged it on every context
switch while the child lived, and restored it when the child exec'd a moment
later -- about 736 KiB moved for a single `/bin/true`, and the reservation is
what failed with "fork: Cannot allocate memory". Measured after: 100
consecutive commands leave `ForkRecovered` exactly where it started. Pipes,
redirections, background jobs and subshells still use `fork`, which they
need.

Three things that took, none of them visible by reading: the child shares the
parent's stack frame, so its work lives in a separate noinline function; it
must not call `tcsetpgrp`, because the parent is asleep until the exec and a
terminal owned by an empty process group makes the shell's next read return
EIO, which bash treats as end of input; and `strvec_from_word_list(alloc=0)`
aliases the caller's words rather than copying them, so disposing the vector
freed memory `bind_lastarg()` reads immediately afterwards.
`build/test-bash-vfork.py` builds the patched bash natively under
AddressSanitizer on a pty and found the last two.

`/proc/meminfo` reports `ForkSwitchMax` and `ForkSwitchLast`: how long a
context switch held interrupts off. A switch over the full 512 KiB ceiling
takes 21.5 ms, longer than the 10 ms timer tick, at about 10 cycles per
memory operation through PSRAM. Lowering the ceiling was tried and reverted:
the login bash needs 368 KiB, so every value that keeps the system working
costs more than a tick. Exchanging pages instead of copying them (Fork,
above) halves the memory, not the time: a switch still moves every page, so
the number stands as the cost of the backend.

### The console

`quiet` in the kernel command line replaced `debug`: the console now carries
KERN_ERR and worse. The log is about 140 lines and 8.4 KB pushed synchronously
to a 115200 console, which is 0.73 s of a 13.7 s boot spent in the UART, and
the ring buffer still holds all of it for `dmesg`. `panic=10` came with it, so
a panic reboots instead of hanging forever, and `no_hash_pointers` went, which
had been printing every `%p` as a real kernel address to anyone who could read
`dmesg` on a board that ships SSH.

`panic_print=0x20` came later, after an afternoon in which nine of ten
panics said nothing but `Kernel panic - not syncing: BUG!`. `BUG()` prints
its `BUG: failure at file:line` with a bare `printk()` -- level 4 -- and
`quiet` passes only what is below 4, so the line that says where went to the
ring buffer and `panic=10` rebooted over it. Now a panic dumps the whole
buffer first. It costs nothing until the boot is lost anyway.

`bootlog verbose` turns the console back up and `bootlog quiet` restores the
default; the setting lives in `/etc` and survives a reboot. The command line
is compiled into the device tree and cannot be changed from a running system,
so `S00bootlog` raises the console level as early as an init script can and
replays the buffer once to cover what came before it. That leaves a real gap:
a fault before it runs, about 1.4 s in, is still only in the buffer, and
reading those needs an image built without `quiet`. The script says so.

### Launching without forking

On NOMMU `vfork` copies nothing: it shares the memory and suspends the parent
until the `exec`. A program that only launches another and execs it does not
need the backend's copy at all, and the two in this image that did were moved
off it. `make` is configured onto `vfork` instead of being forced onto the
fork backend, which it had been on purpose, to exercise it. `jobq` launches
through `posix_spawn`, which reaches `vfork` here -- but only without file
actions: given any, uClibc tries `fork()` and returns `ENOSYS`, because on
NOMMU there is none. Attributes work, with `POSIX_SPAWN_USEVFORK` so that
asking for a process group and default handlers does not veto the vfork path.
jobq no longer reserves twice its own RAM for a copy it does not make.

Measured on the board: the peak system-wide fork shadow for a `make` run and
for a `jobq` run is **0 kB**, down from 432 kB and 248 kB. The page-set
exchange, at its best, only halved those two.

dtach's session shell gets a `vfork` as well. `forkpty()` has to return in the
child and a `vfork` child may not -- it runs on the stack frame it shares with
the suspended parent -- so the pty setup and the exec live in one frame, and
the child makes syscalls only. The daemonized master still forks: it never
execs. socat stays on `fork` for the same reason, eleven times over: of its
twelve fork sites, only one ends in an `exec`, and that one returns into its
caller after writing global state.

### Behaviour

- **The shell fallback only triggers on a real fork failure.** It switched to
  dash and replayed the last command on any non-zero exit status, so `grep`
  finding nothing, a failed `test`, or a command that wrote half a file and
  died were all retried. Bash returns 126 when it cannot fork. It also asks
  before replaying now, keeps its state per process rather than in one shared
  path, and no longer writes a preference to jffs2 at the moment memory ran
  out.
- Starting dash without `-l` meant dash users read no `/etc/profile` at all —
  no PATH, no EDITOR, no umask — which the low-memory switch then made
  permanent.
- `ssh-server` and `web-server` send SIGHUP to inetd instead of killing and
  relaunching it without `-f`, which left the pidfile naming a dead process,
  so stopping inetd stopped working and a later start bound a second one.
  `ssh-server` also had no root check and reported success after failing.
- **`wifi connect` wrote nothing.** Its two configuration heredocs sat inside
  a `( subshell )`, and the busybox ash in the image cannot finish a heredoc
  whose body ends inside parentheses -- `sh: syntax error: unexpected EOF in
  here document`, and no `wpa_supplicant.conf`. `sh -n` accepts the shape and
  the host's busybox runs it, so nothing caught it; every network test in the
  suite is loopback. Found the first time the board was put on a real network
  with the runner watching. The umask that the subshell scoped is saved and
  restored by hand now, and `build/test-wifi-script.py` refuses the shape.
- `wifi --help` printed the script's own source.
- The board keeps a clock across reboots and sends a hostname with its DHCP
  request. Without the first, every boot started in 1970 and TLS failed until
  NTP answered; without the second the router listed the board unnamed.
- udhcpc logs to syslog. On NOMMU it re-execs into the background and sets
  `logmode` to none, so nothing it reported reached `/var/log/network.log`,
  which the README tells you to read.
- **An update no longer takes the wifi and the password with it.** `/etc` is
  its own partition and every flash rewrites it, so the board came back
  unreachable. `S03keepconfig` copies the credentials to `/home`, which
  `flash.sh --parts` preserves, and restores them when `/etc` comes back from
  the factory -- never over a file written since.
- The BLE setup channel closes once wifi is configured. It is how a board
  with no network and no cable gets on one; afterwards it is a resident
  process listening on an unauthenticated link into a root process.
  `ble-prov on|off|auto` overrides it.
- `regulatory.db` loads. It has been in the image all along and cfg80211 asks
  for it 14 ms before the rootfs is mounted; it is built into the kernel now,
  and `iw reg get` reports the real rules instead of the built-in defaults.
- The RSA driver's wait for the accelerator is bounded. It spun forever if
  the firmware had not handed the block over -- the boot stopped dead with
  nothing printed, which DEVELOPMENT.md records as incident 6 with no fix.
  Its self-test no longer runs on every boot, which is 45 ms back.
- `kernel.default_stack_size` is 32 KiB. On NOMMU the stack is one allocation
  with no guard page, and curl, wpa_supplicant, dropbear, nano and iw all have
  a zero `PT_GNU_STACK` and land on it; the manifest records which do.

### Build

- `package-final.py` checks the kernel's link address against the linux
  partition offset, cross-checks `partition-table.bin` against the CSV, and
  refuses an image carrying dropbear keys.
- `flash.sh --backup DIR` reads `/etc` and `/home` off the board, which
  `build/README.md` told you to do without providing a way.
- `run.sh --recover` used esptool 5 spellings that the pinned 4.8.1 rejects.
- The host shim that tests the fork backend stubs `get_ccount()`, the Xtensa
  cycle counter the switch measurement reads. It compiles `nommu-bank.inc`
  natively with `-Werror`, so the counter added for `ForkSwitchMax` stopped
  that build until the stub existed.
- Buildroot's kernel build now installs `regulatory.db` into the kernel tree
  before compiling. `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE` names files the kernel opens
  directly, and only the fork kernel's own build script had been taught to put
  them there, so a clean build stopped after 25 minutes with `No rule to make
  target 'firmware/regulatory.db'`. `build/test-kernel-config.py` now fails if
  a name in `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE` is missing from either build path.
- Host checks run on every push, over every tracked shell script rather than a
  list, with a bashism check on the scripts busybox runs and guards against a
  patch carrying a binary hunk or a file that `new-files/` also ships. The
  patch check now fetches the pinned kernel commit and applies every patch in
  build order, failing on fuzz; it used to look for diff headers. The full
  image build is `workflow_dispatch` only, as the comment always said.
- `home-init` no longer publishes a `/home/www` whose gzip failed after
  streaming, and `S03keepconfig` no longer restores an old password over a
  new one when the network configuration was deleted on purpose: restores
  are gated on a generation stamp, not on a missing file.

## 0.7 — fork, Bash and a userspace that fits (2026-09-08)

- Native NOMMU fork with private software banks, last-owner backup recovery,
  memory counters and quiet-by-default tracing. Not COW or a full MMU;
  UP-only, no multithreaded fork, 512 KiB private-memory limit per fork.
- Bash for user logins; BusyBox remains `/bin/sh` for services. Fixed hush
  login-profile recursion and reduced Bash's initial PID-cache allocation.
- Dash, GNU Make, MicroPython with fork/IPC, socat and nc under normal names.
- Editable `/home/www`, private user homes, `su`/`passwd`, dtach sessions,
  persistent per-user cron and working `@reboot`. No SQLite, sudo or doas.
- Process compatibility tests, `programbench`, memory-aware `jobq`, selectable
  image profiles and checked removal of ELF debug/section metadata.
- Removed nonessential source comments while preserving licenses and
  functional directives/configuration/patch-matching data.
- Added a clean, pinned-source container pipeline producing a complete
  16 MiB image and checksums.
- Ship the factory `/home` formatted instead of erased, fixing the observed
  first-boot stall at `mkdir`. The clean image from `ee9e06d` passed 26/26
  hardware checks; its exact hash and scope are recorded under `build/verification/`.
- Check flashing inputs, sizes and partition layout before any erase; preserve
  paths with spaces and document which modes overwrite `/etc` and `/home`.
- Restore `flash.sh --help` and add host-only regression tests with a simulated
  flasher. Distinguish functional clean-build validation from bit-identical builds.
- Two independent builds of the same commit differ only in `/etc/shadow`, from
  Buildroot's random password salt; everything else matches byte for byte.
- Keep booting when `/home` is slow: `S06home-users` waits a bounded 45 seconds
  for `home-init` and continues, and `web-server migrate` no longer writes to
  `/etc` on every boot. A board whose `/home` needed reclaim previously stopped
  reaching the login prompt.
- Retry the ESP-IDF tool download and stop the build when it still fails. A
  transient `504` from GitHub used to be ignored, and the run carried on until
  the firmware stage died with an unrelated looking mesage.
- Boot to a login prompt in about 14 seconds from reset. Init no longer blocks
  on `/home` and writes less to flash while starting, and the validated run
  completed boot and all 27 tests with no OOM kill in `dmesg`.
- Stop the DHCP client and protect the console shell before running the board
  suite. Its script forks on every retry, and on an idle image with ~1.3 MiB
  free that was enough for the OOM killer to take the console shell out from
  under the cron test.
- Retry a benchmark whose measured program is killed by the OOM killer, up to
  three times, printing each retry. Measuring Bash leaves under 100 KiB free,
  so a DHCP lease event forking its script there was enough to kill it and
  abort the whole benchmark step. A non-kill failure still fails immediately.
- Stream the build to the terminal instead of hiding it in a log, state its
  cost before starting, and report elapsed time; `-q` restores the quiet form.
- Add `./run.sh`, a menu-driven driver for the whole path: environment checks,
  clean build, checksums, flashing, the board suite, a two-build reproducibility
  comparison and a factory restore. Every step is also a flag, so it runs
  unattended. It finds an interpreter with pyserial, avoids reusing an output
  directory, and offers to close a console holding the serial port.
- Take an image directory with `./flash.sh --images DIR`, so the same checked
  flasher serves the committed 0.6 release and a freshly built artifacts
  directory. `--parts --erase` writes a factory `home.jffs2` when the directory
  has one and otherwise leaves `/home` erased, which the board formats on its
  first write. `images/` keeps the 0.7 release, matching its own combined
  image byte for byte.
- Known limitation of the platform, not fixed here: once jffs2 has to reclaim
  and erase used blocks, write throughput collapses. The published 0.6 kernel
  behaves the same way, so this is not new in this branch.

The entries below describe earlier releases and retain their original limits.

## 0.6 — the clock sets itself, the web page stays on (2026-07-31)

**Two things that had to be redone after every single boot no longer do.** The
clock now comes from the network instead of starting at 1 Jan 1970, which is
what made every HTTPS request fail; and the status page has a switch that
survives a restart. Neither needed new machinery — both are one small script
hung off something the board already did.

Verified twice over. On a **fully erased board**, not an incremental reflash:
erase, write the combined image, join WiFi from nothing, and the clock sets
itself and HTTPS works with nothing typed by hand. And rebuilt from this
repository alone by GitHub Actions in Docker, where all seven images come out
at exactly the size of the ones committed here and the two that carry nothing
of the machine that built them are byte-identical.

### The clock sets itself

The board has no RTC, so it powered on in 1970 and *every* HTTPS request failed
until someone typed `date -s` by hand. It now asks NTP.

- `CONFIG_NTPD=y` in the busybox config (client only — a board that has just
  learnt the time has no business serving it). This is the only new code on the
  image: `rootfs.cramfs` grows by one 16 KB block, 6,832,128 → 6,848,512 bytes,
  leaving 992 KB free in the partition.
- The sync runs from a **udhcpc hook**, `/usr/share/udhcpc/default.script.d/50-set-clock`,
  not an init script. udhcpc calls its hooks after the address, the default
  route and `resolv.conf` are all in place, which is the first moment an NTP
  query can succeed; an init script would have to sit in a loop waiting for
  exactly that.
- It runs in the background — udhcpc waits for the script and `ifup` waits for
  udhcpc, and since 0.5 the boot deliberately does not wait for `ifup`. It
  cannot linger either: `ntpd -q` arms a 10 s alarm at startup (50 s once some
  peer has replied) and kills itself when it fires.
- Three peers: `pool.ntp.org`, plus Cloudflare's and Google's time servers as
  **IP literals**, so a network where DNS is broken but UDP 123 works still
  gets the time. Cloudflare is listed only as an address — with the name there
  too, both resolve to the same host and ntpd drops one as a duplicate peer.
- On `bound` it always syncs; on `renew` only if the clock is still unset. A
  lease renewal on a board that already knows the year is not a reason to go
  ask again.
- What it did lands in `/var/log/network.log`, next to what `ifup` did.

### `web-server on|off|status`

The status page needed `httpd -h /www -p 80` typed again after every reboot.
Now it has the same helper `ssh-server` has, and for the same reasons.

- The switch is a line in `/etc/inetd.conf`, on the writable `/etc` partition,
  so it survives a reboot. inetd starts httpd only when someone actually
  connects: enabled-but-unvisited costs no process and no RAM, which matters
  more here than the per-request spawn does.
- **Off by default**, unchanged. An unauthenticated HTTP port is not something
  to hand out unasked.
- The service field is the port number, not `http`: busybox inetd takes either,
  but `/etc/services` calls port 80 `www` with `http` only as an alias.
- Verified end to end with busybox inetd + `httpd -i` before it went near the
  board, CGI included.

### `flash.sh --parts` wrote three of the six pieces to the wrong place

The offsets were typed into the script and had drifted from the partition
table: `/etc` landed inside the firmware partition and the kernel 128K below
where the bootloader looks for it. esptool reports success and the board never
boots. `--parts` is the road less travelled — the combined image is the
documented path and `make-images.sh` builds it by reading the same table — so
nothing caught it.

Rather than correct the numbers and leave the next drift to chance, the script
now reads them out of `partition_table.esp32s3.16m8r`, the same CSV
`make-images.sh` generates `partition-table.bin` from. Change the table and
both follow. Verified by moving two partitions in the CSV and watching the
offsets move with them, with the script untouched.

Only `0x0` (bootloader) and `0x8000` (the partition table itself) stay
constants, because they cannot come from a table that has not been found yet.

### CI checks the build against the images here, not just that it builds

A green run used to mean "it compiled and packaged". It never compared the
result with what this repository ships, which is the one thing a build from a
clean checkout is worth running for.

- The packaging job keeps a copy of the committed images before
  `make-images.sh` overwrites them, and prints a table — to the log and to the
  run summary — of size and byte equality for each.
- It reports rather than fails. Byte-identical is not the expected outcome for
  most of them: the kernel embeds the `user@host` that built it, so a Docker
  build and a native one differ in length there and every pointer table after
  it shifts. `bootloader.bin` and `partition-table.bin` carry no such thing and
  must match exactly; if those two ever differ the summary says so outright.
- Caught while testing that step: iterating over `images/*.bin` silently skips
  `rootfs.cramfs`, `xipImage` and `etc.jffs2` — three of the four that can
  actually differ. It walks both directories by name now.
- `include-hidden-files` on the raw build artifact. A build tree is mostly
  dotfiles, and v4 quietly stopped including them, so repackaging a downloaded
  artifact was not the same as repackaging the tree it came from.
- A concurrency group, the artifact actions moved to their current majors after
  checking every input the workflow uses still exists, and `make-images.sh`
  now says *"there is no toolchain here"* instead of failing obscurely when the
  vector address moves in a packaging job that has no compiler.

The first run of it, on this release: seven of seven sizes equal, two
byte-identical, the vector address in agreement, and no WiFi credentials baked
into the image.

### Also

- **TROUBLESHOOTING**: `jffs2: Name CRC failed on node at 0x...`, which is a
  directory entry written only half way — jffs2 spots it at mount, discards it
  and carries on. Seen here after a flash that was interrupted part way; a full
  erase cleared it. Includes how to tell which of the two writable partitions
  it is, and why nothing important can be lost that way.
- **TROUBLESHOOTING**: `sh: bad number`, printed by hush after almost every
  command substitution in an interactive shell — including `$(echo hi)`, which
  runs no external program. It is hush re-executing busybox because a NOMMU
  system cannot fork. Values are always correct and scripts are unaffected.
- **SECURITY**: the NTP queries as their own trade-off. Unsolicited outbound
  traffic to three third parties, unauthenticated, and whoever can intercept it
  decides whether an expired certificate looks valid to this board.

## 0.5 — SoftAP gone, faster boot, reproducible (2026-07-26)

**A new binary.** The SoftAP is removed from both the driver and the firmware,
the cold boot is down from 14.6 s to 11.0 s, and the whole thing has been
rebuilt from a clean clone of this repo and booted again.

### Build reproducibility

A build made from a clean clone did not reproduce the released image; these are
the defects that stood in the way, all found on hardware.

- The Docker image was missing `cpio`, which buildroot checks for *after*
  crosstool-NG has compiled the entire toolchain — hours in, at the most
  expensive point.
- `03-buildroot-tracked-changes.patch` carried a compiled binary `git apply`
  cannot reconstruct, so it was rejected in full on every fresh clone — and the
  failure was read as "already applied" and ignored. Builds reported success
  while producing images with no `/etc/fstab`, `inetd.conf` or `S05home`.
- The firmware patch had drifted behind the tree the images were built from: it
  was missing the RSA handover (without which **the kernel hangs at boot with no
  output**), the entire BLE link, and a vendored ESP-IDF change. Regenerated
  from that tree and verified byte for byte.
- The defconfig had drifted too: `setup-home.sh` was not being run, so root
  landed in `/root` on the read-only cramfs. And buildroot's own default
  `wpa_supplicant.conf` was reaching the image, making a clean build join any
  open WiFi network by itself.

A full from-scratch build in Docker now runs to completion and the result boots
on hardware.

Since confirmed the harder way: a clean clone of this repo, built end to end
and flashed, boots and joins WiFi. Five of the six images come out at exactly
the size of the ones committed here and `etc.jffs2` within 4 bytes, but only
`bootloader.bin` and `partition-table.bin` are byte-identical. That clone was
built in Docker and these images natively, which is most of the difference:
the kernel carries the build `user@host` in its version string, and a
different length there shifts every pointer table after it. See DEVELOPMENT.md
for the full accounting.

### SoftAP removed for real

0.3 disabled the SoftAP; the code stayed behind, unreachable. It is now gone
from both sides, and the binaries change accordingly.

- Kernel: `01-kernel-esp32ng-ap-support.patch` is deleted. The esp32-ng driver
  is pristine upstream plus the BLE pipe — no `.start_ap`/`.stop_ap`, no
  `cmd_ap_start`/`cmd_ap_stop`, no `CMD_AP_*`/`EVENT_AP_*` codes, no
  `ap_iface`/`esp_ap_password` module parameters, `ESP_MAX_INTERFACE` back to 1.
  This is a no-op for the STA: the removed refactor threaded `priv->if_type`
  through 19 call sites, and on a STA-only build that value is always
  `ESP_STA_IF` — exactly the constant upstream hardcodes.
- Firmware: `cmd.c` is byte-identical to upstream again. WiFi start-up returns
  to upstream's model (event loop and `esp_wifi_start()` inside
  `process_init_interface()`, behind the `!sta_init_flag` guard) rather than
  starting once at boot, which was only ever done so the AP beacon would carry
  its RSN element.
- The vendored ESP-IDF needs no patch now, so `06-idf-hostap-sta-join.patch`
  is gone; `hostap_sta_join` is `static` again.
- One entry of that `wpa_funcs` block had to go back: `wpa_sta_set_ap_rsnxe`
  sits among the AP callbacks but belongs to the supplicant —
  `wpa_sm_set_ap_rsnxe` lives in `rsn_supp/wpa.c` and records the RSNXE the
  *access point* advertised. `initialise_wifi()` memsets `wpa_cb` and re-fills
  it, so anything `esp_supplicant_init()` had set is lost unless restored by
  hand. With it NULL the blob logs `wifi:null wpa_sta_ap_set_rsnxe` on every
  association: WPA2-PSK still associates and routes, but the message lands on
  the serial console mid-command, and WPA3/SAE-H2E does need the callback.
  Caught on hardware after the removal, not by review.
- The firmware is also **built** without SoftAP:
  `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SOFTAP_SUPPORT=n` keeps the SDK's own AP machinery
  (`esp_hostap.c`, the `ap/` authenticator sources, the WiFi lib's SoftAP init)
  out of the image. ESP-IDF supports this directly — with the option off it
  compiles an empty `net80211_softap_funcs_init()` over the weak symbol in the
  closed WiFi lib. `network_adapter.bin` drops from 721,632 to 686,992 bytes,
  and the fixed 768K `factory` partition goes from 8% to 13% free — headroom
  the BLE stack had nearly used up.
- Rootfs: `/etc/udhcpd.conf` (a DHCP server for the AP's clients) and the
  busybox `udhcpd` applet are gone. `udhcpc`, the client the STA needs, stays.
- Two build-system defects found on the way: `apply-local-changes.sh` copied
  `new-files/board/` with `rsync` and no `--delete`, so a deleted kernel patch
  would linger in the buildroot tree and keep being applied; and the reference
  copy in `kernel-driver-esp32-ng/` was stale — it shipped `esp_ble_prov.c`
  while its `Makefile` did not build it.

Verified on hardware: RSA self-tests pass, `espsta0` is the only netdev, and a
WiFi scan returns results — the operation the SoftAP used to wedge.

### Boot time: 14.6 s → 11.0 s to a login prompt

Measured from the first serial byte after reset, repeatable to 0.01 s over
several cold boots. All of it came out of userspace (8.4 s → 4.8 s); the kernel
and firmware phases are unchanged at 6.2 s.

- **`S40network` no longer blocks the boot** (~2.2 s). `ifup -a` moves to the
  background: nothing later in the boot needs the network — inetd binds
  regardless of link state and the BLE link talks over `/dev/esp-ble` — and the
  interface finishes coming up behind the login prompt. It was pure waiting:
  `/etc/network/interfaces` declares `espsta0` as `inet dhcp` with
  wpa_supplicant in a *post-up* hook, so udhcpc starts before the radio has
  even associated. Its output goes to `/var/log/network.log` instead of landing
  on top of the prompt; `/etc/init.d/S40network start-fg` runs it in the
  foreground by hand.
- **`S02sysctl` replaced** (~1.4 s). Buildroot's generic version scans five
  directories with `find`, pipes through `xargs` and `readlink`, and builds a
  two-stage `logger` pipeline — about ten process spawns to apply the single
  line this board has. On XIP cramfs with a NOMMU libc that is not free.
- **cron removed** (~0.8 s). Nothing on the board used it, there are no
  crontabs, and its own stop path was broken (`no /usr/sbin/crond found`).
  `CONFIG_CROND=n` also stops buildroot from installing `S50crond`.
- **iptables no longer starts at boot** (~0.6 s), while staying installed. It
  had nothing to restore — the SoftAP's NAT is gone — so `trim-target.sh` drops
  the `S35` prefix: `rcS` only runs `/etc/init.d/S??*`, and
  `/etc/init.d/iptables start` still works by hand.

One thing this did *not* touch: 2.48 s of the kernel's 4.2 s goes into a single
gap around `of_fixed_clk_driver_init`, where the console hands over from
earlycon to `ttyS0`. It is not initcall time (all 170 initcalls together come
to 0.87 s), and `initcall_debug` cannot be used to look at it — it hangs the
board at exactly that point, mid-character. Still unexplained.

## 0.4 — WiFi setup over Bluetooth (2026-07-22)

Join the board to WiFi **from a phone, with no PC and no cable**. It advertises
over BLE as `Esp32-Linux`; connect with any BLE serial terminal, send a
character, pick a network from the list. The ESP32-S3 has no Bluetooth Classic,
so this is the Nordic UART Service over BLE.

Wait about 30 seconds after power-on before connecting — the BLE stack comes up
long before Linux has finished booting, and that window is unreliable.

- NimBLE peripheral on core 0 as a byte pipe to Linux (`/dev/esp-ble`); the
  dialog runs through the existing `wifi` command, so the driver state cannot
  desynchronise.
- The kernel's vector address is now kept in sync with the firmware
  automatically, instead of being a hand-maintained constant that silently
  killed the boot when the firmware changed size.

## 0.3 — SoftAP removed, nano, interactive wifi (2026-07-18)

- **SoftAP removed; STA only.** The closed WiFi blob beaconed as WEP, and
  bringing the AP up wedged the firmware so the STA could no longer scan. The
  board now joins networks rather than hosting them, which also makes scanning
  reliable.
- **nano** replaces the busybox `vi` applet; `vi` is a symlink to it.
- **Interactive `wifi`.** Scan, list numbered, pick one — open networks connect
  straight away, secured ones prompt. 0.2's README promised `wifi connect`
  before the command existed; now it does.
- **One full-flash image.** Flashing it alone rewrites the whole 16 MB chip.

## 0.2 — native Xtensa Linux (2026-07-17)

**Linux runs natively on the ESP32-S3.** 0.1 ran Linux on a RISC-V emulator
hosted on the chip; this replaces it with a real Linux 6.11 kernel compiled for
Xtensa, executing on the chip's own cores. No interpreter in the middle.

Verified on a fully erased board: boots to a login prompt, the RSA accelerator
passes its self-tests, the rootfs mounts from flash, telnet comes up, and the
board reaches the internet.

## 0.1 (2026-07-13)

First release: Linux on a RISC-V emulator hosted on the ESP32-S3. Superseded by
0.2, which is better in every respect; kept for the history.
